## Overview

RL Swarm now supports a **Google Drive-only mode** that eliminates all external dependencies:

### ✅ What's Included
- Google Drive-based rollout sharing (no P2P networking)
- Configurable publish frequency (generation/stage/round)
- Configurable retention policies (keep all, keep N rounds, archive)
- Automatic cleanup of old rollouts
- Local caching to reduce API calls
- Retry logic for API rate limits
- Full backward compatibility (Hivemind mode still works)

### ❌ What's Removed
- Peer identity files (swarm.pem, identity_*.pem)
- Hivemind P2P networking
- Peer discovery via multiaddrs
- Docker containers
- Blockchain coordination
- Modal login authentication
- Web server/API

### ✨ Benefits
- **Simpler**: No networking, no crypto, no complex setup
- **More Private**: All data stays in user's Google Drive
- **Debuggable**: All rollouts visible as plain JSON files
- **Colab-friendly**: No firewall/NAT issues
- **Flexible**: Fully configurable retention policies

## Architecture

### Communication Backend

The new `GDriveCommunicationBackend` replaces `HivemindBackend` and implements the same GenRL `Communication` interface:

```python
class GDriveCommunicationBackend(Communication):
    def get_id(self) -> str:
        """Returns node's unique identifier"""

    def publish_state(self, state_dict, stage=None, generation=None):
        """Publishes rollouts to Google Drive based on frequency"""

    def get_swarm_states(self, round_num=None, stage=None) -> Dict:
        """Fetches rollouts from other peers with caching"""

    def advance_stage(self):
        """Hook called when stage advances"""

    def advance_round(self):
        """Hook called when round advances - triggers cleanup"""
```

### Rollout Sharing

The `GDriveRolloutSharing` class handles low-level file operations:

```python
class GDriveRolloutSharing:
    def publish_rollouts(peer_id, round_num, stage, generation, rollouts_dict):
        """Publishes rollouts based on configured frequency"""

    def fetch_rollouts(round_num, stage, max_peers=10) -> Dict:
        """Fetches rollouts from other peers"""

    def cleanup_old_rollouts(current_round):
        """Removes/archives old rollouts based on retention policy"""

    def flush_buffer(peer_id, round_num):
        """Flushes buffered rollouts for stage/round frequencies"""
```

### Data Flow

```
Training Loop
    ↓
publish_state() [frequency-aware]
    ↓
GDriveRolloutSharing.publish_rollouts()
    ↓
    ├─ frequency='generation' → Write immediately
    ├─ frequency='stage' → Buffer until stage ends
    └─ frequency='round' → Buffer until round ends
    ↓
Write to: /rollouts/round_X/stage_Y/{peer_id}.json
```

```
Training Loop
    ↓
get_swarm_states() [with caching]
    ↓
Check local cache
    ↓
    ├─ Cache hit → Return cached data
    └─ Cache miss ↓
        ↓
    GDriveRolloutSharing.fetch_rollouts()
        ↓
    Read from: /rollouts/round_X/stage_Y/*.json
        ↓
    Cache results
```

## Configuration

### Rollout Publish Frequency

Controls when rollouts are written to Google Drive:

```yaml
rollout_publish_frequency: 'stage'  # Options: generation, stage, round
```

| Frequency | When Published | API Calls/Round | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `generation` | After each generation | Highest | Real-time sharing, debugging |
| `stage` | After each stage | Medium | **Recommended** - balanced |
| `round` | After each round | Lowest | Resource-constrained, slow connections |

### Retention Policy

Controls how long to keep old rollouts:

```yaml
rollout_retention:
  cleanup_enabled: false           # Set to true to enable cleanup
  keep_last_n_rounds: 10          # Keep last N rounds
  archive_old_rollouts: false     # Archive instead of delete
  archive_path: /path/to/archive
```

### Example Configurations

#### Development (keep everything)
```yaml
rollout_publish_frequency: 'stage'
rollout_retention:
  cleanup_enabled: false
```

#### Production (cleanup with archive)
```yaml
rollout_publish_frequency: 'stage'
rollout_retention:
  cleanup_enabled: true
  keep_last_n_rounds: 10
  archive_old_rollouts: true
```

#### Resource-constrained (aggressive cleanup)
```yaml
rollout_publish_frequency: 'round'
rollout_retention:
  cleanup_enabled: true
  keep_last_n_rounds: 3
  archive_old_rollouts: false
```

### Full Configuration Reference

See `rgym_exp/config/colab-gdrive.yaml` for the complete configuration with all available options and detailed comments.

## Usage Guide

### Running on Google Colab

#### Coordinator Node

```python
# In notebooks/colab_coordinator.ipynb

# Configuration
EXPERIMENT_NAME = 'qwen_0.6b_seed42'  # Must be same across all nodes
NODE_ID = 'coordinator_0'
MODEL_NAME = 'Gensyn/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct'
SEED = 42

# Rollout Configuration
ROLLOUT_PUBLISH_FREQUENCY = 'stage'
ROLLOUT_CLEANUP_ENABLED = False
ROLLOUT_KEEP_LAST_N_ROUNDS = 10
ROLLOUT_ARCHIVE_OLD = False

# Run all cells
```

#### Worker Nodes

```python
# In notebooks/colab_worker.ipynb (separate Colab sessions)

# Configuration
EXPERIMENT_NAME = 'qwen_0.6b_seed42'  # SAME as coordinator
NODE_ID = 'worker_1'                  # DIFFERENT for each worker
MODEL_NAME = 'Gensyn/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct'  # SAME
SEED = 42                             # SAME

# Rollout Configuration (should match coordinator)
ROLLOUT_PUBLISH_FREQUENCY = 'stage'
ROLLOUT_CLEANUP_ENABLED = False

# Run all cells
```

### Command Line (Local Testing)

```bash
# Set environment variables
export GDRIVE_PATH="/path/to/gdrive/rl-swarm"
export EXPERIMENT_NAME="test_experiment"
export NODE_ID="node_0"
export MODEL_NAME="Gensyn/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"
export ROLLOUT_PUBLISH_FREQUENCY="stage"
export ROLLOUT_CLEANUP_ENABLED="False"

# Run training
python -m rgym_exp.runner.swarm_launcher --config-name colab-gdrive
```

### Multiple Workers

To run multiple workers, simply:
1. Use separate Colab sessions
2. Keep `EXPERIMENT_NAME` the same
3. Use different `NODE_ID` for each (e.g., `worker_1`, `worker_2`, `worker_3`)
4. All other config should match

### Rollout File Format

```json
{
  "peer_id": "coordinator_0",
  "round": 5,
  "stage": 0,
  "timestamp": 1696800000.0,
  "rollouts": {
    "0": [
      {
        "prompt": "...",
        "response": "...",
        "reward": 0.85
      }
    ],
    "1": [...]
  }
}
```

### Storage Estimates

With 4 nodes, 2 stages/round, `frequency='stage'`:

| Rounds | Storage | Google Drive Free Tier |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| 100 | ~8 MB | 15 GB (187,500 rounds) |
| 1000 | ~80 MB | ✓ |
| 10000 | ~800 MB | ✓ |

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Single Node Test
```bash
# Start coordinator only
# Verify:
# - Rollout files created in /rollouts/round_X/stage_Y/
# - No errors in logs
# - Training progresses normally
```

#### 2. Multi-Node Test
```bash
# Start coordinator + 2 workers
# Verify:
# - All nodes create rollout files
# - Each node fetches rollouts from others
# - SAPO transplant_trees receives external rollouts
# - Training uses swarm rollouts
```

#### 3. Retention Policy Test
```bash
# Enable cleanup: cleanup_enabled=true, keep_last_n_rounds=5
# Run for 10 rounds
# Verify:
# - Only rounds 5-9 exist in /rollouts/
# - Older rounds deleted or archived
# - Training continues normally
```

#### 4. Resume After Disconnect
```bash
# Start training, run 5 rounds
# Stop (simulate disconnect)
# Restart with same EXPERIMENT_NAME and NODE_ID
# Verify:
# - Old rollout files still accessible
# - Training resumes from checkpoint
# - No data loss
```

#### 5. Publish Frequency Test
```bash
# Test each frequency setting:
# - frequency='generation': Files per generation
# - frequency='stage': Files per stage
# - frequency='round': Files per round
# Verify correct aggregation and timing
```

### Performance Benchmarks

Expected overhead compared to Hivemind:
- **Latency:** +1-2 seconds per stage (Google Drive API)
- **API calls:** ~16 calls per stage (4 nodes)
- **Impact:** <1% for typical training (5-10 min/round)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No rollout files created
- Check `GDRIVE_PATH` is correct
- Verify `EXPERIMENT_NAME` matches
- Check permissions on Google Drive directory
- Look for errors in logs

#### Worker can't find coordinator rollouts
- Ensure `EXPERIMENT_NAME` is identical
- Check rollout files exist: `/rollouts/round_X/stage_Y/coordinator_*.json`
- Verify no typos in experiment name
- Check Google Drive sync status

#### Rate limit errors
- Reduce publish frequency: `'stage'` → `'round'`
- Enable caching: `cache_rollouts: true`
- Reduce number of peers: `fetch_max_peers: 5`
- Increase timeout: `fetch_timeout_seconds: 60`

#### Out of storage
- Enable cleanup: `cleanup_enabled: true`
- Reduce retention: `keep_last_n_rounds: 5`
- Enable archiving to external location
- Manually delete old experiments

#### Slow training
- Check Google Drive sync isn't bottleneck
- Enable caching: `cache_rollouts: true`
- Use `frequency='round'` for fewer API calls
- Check network connection quality

### Debug Tips

1. **Check rollout files:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh /content/drive/MyDrive/rl-swarm/experiments/{EXPERIMENT_NAME}/rollouts/
   ```

2. **Verify rollout content:**
   ```python
   import json
   with open('rollouts/round_5/stage_0/coordinator_0.json') as f:
       data = json.load(f)
       print(f"Peer: {data['peer_id']}, Rollouts: {len(data['rollouts'])}")
   ```

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f /content/drive/MyDrive/rl-swarm/experiments/{EXPERIMENT_NAME}/logs/{NODE_ID}/training_events.jsonl
   ```

4. **Monitor API calls:**
   - Look for "Retry" messages in logs
   - Check for rate limit warnings
   - Verify exponential backoff is working

## Migration Guide

### From Hivemind Mode to GDrive-Only

If you have existing code using Hivemind:

1. **Update config file:**
   ```yaml
   # OLD
   communication:
     _target_: genrl.communication.hivemind.hivemind_backend.HivemindBackend

   # NEW
   communication:
     _target_: rgym_exp.communication.gdrive_backend.GDriveCommunicationBackend
   ```

2. **Remove peer identity generation:**
   - Delete cells that create `swarm.pem`
   - Remove `IDENTITY_PATH` environment variable
   - Use `NODE_ID` configuration instead

3. **Add rollout configuration:**
   ```python
   ROLLOUT_PUBLISH_FREQUENCY = 'stage'
   ROLLOUT_CLEANUP_ENABLED = False
   ```

4. **No code changes needed!**
   - GDriveCommunicationBackend implements same interface
   - Manager automatically detects backend type
   - Training logic unchanged

### Backward Compatibility

Hivemind mode still works! To use it:

1. Keep `identity_path` in config
2. Use `HivemindBackend` in communication section
3. Don't set `gdrive.base_path` in config

The system auto-detects which mode to use based on config.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Specifications

**Rollout Sharing:**
- Protocol: File-based JSON in Google Drive
- Format: Same as Hivemind (dict of batch_id → payloads)
- Frequency: Configurable (generation/stage/round)
- Caching: Local in-memory cache with invalidation
- Retry: Exponential backoff (2^n seconds, max 3 retries)

**Retention:**
- Cleanup: Triggered after each round advancement
- Archive: Copy to separate directory before delete
- Policy: Keep last N rounds, configurable
- Safety: Never deletes current or previous round

**Performance:**
- Buffering: Reduces API calls for stage/round frequencies
- Atomic writes: Temp file + rename prevents corruption
- Caching: Reduces redundant API reads
- Lazy loading: Fetches only when needed

**Compatibility:**
- GenRL interface: Full compatibility with existing code
- Manager hooks: Minimal changes to manager.py
- Config system: Hydra/OmegaConf integration
- Error handling: Graceful degradation on API failures
