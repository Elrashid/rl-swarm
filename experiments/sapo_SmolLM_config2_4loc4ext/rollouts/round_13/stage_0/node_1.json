In other words, the number of odd numbers greater than 1300 is the number of numbers less than 1300 that are not divisible by 13. Here are the number of numbers in the sequence:\n\n* The last digit of 2438 is not divisible by 13, which means that there are no odd numbers that are less than 1300.\n* The last digit of 3057 is not divisible by 13, which means that there are no odd numbers that are less than 1300.\n* The last digit of 2786 is not divisible by 13, which means that there are no odd numbers that",
          "Let the number 2438 be x.\nSince we need to compute it minus 1300, we divide 2438 by 1300 and get an integer.\nThe quotient is 243 and the remainder is -130.\n35.3649999999999999  (Feasible solution...\")\n\nNote: 35.3649999999999999 is the 36.00th permutation of 35 (permutation!), so if you added 1000 before the subtraction, the result would have the same value."
