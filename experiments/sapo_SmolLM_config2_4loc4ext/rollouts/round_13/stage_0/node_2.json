Define the recursive function `print_function(X, Y, num)` that takes input `X` and `Y` as arguments and calculates the sum and product of the input values.\n3. In the `print` statement, use the recursive function to print the sum of `X` with the value of `Y`.\n4. If the input is `'yes'`, immediately exit the current function block, and the program will halt correctly.\n5. If the input is `{'yes'}` and the output is `'-' + '-' + \" 'yes' 'yes' 'yes' 'no'', your code will not run and the program will halt.\n\nExample Terms:\n```\nprint_with_line(-0.1, 0.3)  # 1.0\nprint_with_line(1.0, 2.0)  # 1.3\nprint_with_",

The program is designed to perform a specific task, such as calculating the result of a mathematical expression or generating a piece of text.\n\nHere is the detailed output of the program for the input statements:\n\nInput: Hello, world!\nOutput: Hello, world!\n\nThese are the expected results given inputs to the loop, Move Case, forfunction. The first statement moves the characters from the front of the string to the end. The second statement moves the characters from the front of the string to the left, and the last statement moves the characters from the end of the string to the beginning again. The if(conditional statement checks if the contents of the string are even or odd and, if so, moves the characters to the beginning or ends accordingly, respectively.",
