          "To find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, we need to solve the given problems in a systematic and detailed manner. First, we identify the common elements in all three example grids. Here's the reasoning I followed:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nIn the input grid, we can see that there are certain elements, like zeros, and there are others, like ones. We can eliminate all zeros and keep only ones. This is a straightforward method.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nIn the input grid, we can group the elements in different manners. For example, we can group all ones into rows and rows into columns. This approach is straightforward and efficient.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\nInstead of grouping elements separately, we can use a transparent approach. We can compute a flat matrix of the grid and then divide it into cells. This approach is more elegant and provides a more accurate result.\n\nAs we can see from the questions and examples, the common technique used to solve these problems is to break down the problem into smaller steps, solve each step independently, and then combine the results to form the final output grid.",
