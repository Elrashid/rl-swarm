          "To simplify fractions, you can multiply both the numerator and numerator by 4350 and subtract them from the first fraction.

Therefore, Q is determined if we only know that P and Q are true. Therefore, Q is determined if only P is true. If only P is true, then P is determined and Q is determined. If only Q is true, then P and Q are determined. The conclusion is P \u2192 P and Q \u2192 Q. Therefore, the whole modal logics system can conclude.",
          "Answer:\nA computer program will automatically remove offensive language from outgoing emails by formatting them using a specific syntax. It will typically perform this action using a combination of software tools and algorithms that can accurately detect and remove certain types of offensive language. The program will then compare the output of the software with the input email and update its internal data base as the offensive language is replaced with correct replacement language.\n\nThe output of the program can be displayed in a variety of ways, including in emails itself, or in a more comprehensive reporting card that displays the number of opportunities mentioned for correction. The program will also provide information on the number of opportunities remaining and advice on how to correct them in future reports. In the event of any errors or inaccuracies in the program's actions, the user can simply opt out by clicking the \"Question Mark\" button.\n\nThe program also includes a feature that allows users to import their own formatting preferences for their emails, if they so desire. This is useful for sharing emails across an organization or sending them to destinations with specific default formatting.\n\nThe program is available for download for Mac flashes in iOS 12 and later, and can be installed on Chrome extensions for Linux, Windows, and macOS.",
          "Formal Logical Reasoning:\nTo answer this question, we can use the following arguments to arrive at the conclusion:\n\n1. (P \u2227 Q) implies (Q \u2194 Q): We can use this to arrive at the conclusion that P must be true and that Q True to establish that the premises imply the conclusion. Therefore, the premise (P) implies the conclusion (Q).\n2. (Q \u2227 P) \u2192 (Q \u2228 P): Analogously, we use this to arrive at the conclusion that Q is false and that P is false to establish that the premises imply the conclusion. Therefore, the premises imply the conclusion. This leads us to (Q \u2227 P) \u2192 (Q \u2228 P) which implies that Q would be true and P is false. Therefore, the premises imply the conclusion. So, we can conclude that P implies the conclusion.\n3. (Q \u2227 P) \u2192 (Q \u2228 P) implies (Q \u2227 P) \u2192 (Q \u2227 P) \u2192 R: It follows from this that if Q is not true, then it follows that P must be false, and therefore P cannot be true. Therefore, if Q is not true, and P cannot be true, then P"
