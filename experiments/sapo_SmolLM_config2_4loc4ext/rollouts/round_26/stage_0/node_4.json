          "The simplified fraction methods for step-by-step differentiation can be found in various mathematical textbooks and online resources. Here is a step-by-step example of how to simplify a fraction:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Common Divisor**\n\nLet's simplify the fraction $\\frac{529}{805}$ by finding the common difference and common multiple of the numerator and denominator.\n\nCommon Divisor: We can apply the principle of extended division, which is a bit tricky, but it can help us calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. In this case, GCD is 2. This means that the numerator and denominator of both fractions can be expressed as products of prime numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Division Algorithm**\n\nLet's break down the numerator and denominator into their prime factors and the common factor.\n\n(1) $\\frac{529}{805}\\Rightarrow a \\equiv 1 \\mod 805$ and $\\frac{529}{805x}: a = b \\equiv b \\mod 805$\n\n(2) $\\frac{529}{805",

You can rewrite the fraction $\\frac{529}{805}$ as $\\frac{529 \\div 100}{805 \\div 100}$.\n\t2. The units place in the numerator makes $100$ divide evenly into the denominator.\n\t3. You can compare values of $100$ and $805$ and choose the largest value.\n\t4. The numerator is $529 \\div 100 = 529 \\cdot 10 = 5290$, and the denominator is $805 \\div 100 = 805 \\div 10 = 80, we get $",
          "The objective is to simplify this fraction to its lowest terms. Simplifying a fraction means expressing it in its simplest form such that its numerator is less than or equal to its denominator and the numerator is a power of 10.\n\nA power of 10 is a factor of a number, and the power of 10 that is less than or equal to the number is its place value.\n\nTo simplify $\\frac{529}{805}$, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. The fraction can be rewritten as $\\frac{529 \\cdot 10^{-1}}{805 \\cdot 10^{-1}}$.\n2. Take the power of negative 1.\n3. Multiply both the numerator and denominator by 100.\n4. Simplify the expression inside the brackets.\n\nHint: To simplify a fraction, you may need to simplify the fraction outside the parentheses by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\nAs a result, we get:\n\nSimplify the fraction: $\\frac{1,940,230}{8,086,520"
