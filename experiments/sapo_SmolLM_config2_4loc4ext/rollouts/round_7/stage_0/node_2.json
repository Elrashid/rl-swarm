          "To find the taxicab distance of the nearest 0 for each cell in a matrix, we can create a 0-to-1 matrix and find the index of the cell with the shorter distance to the nearest 0.\n\nThe task involves calculating the distance between a cell and the nearest 0 in a matrix. This can be achieved by iterating over the indices and checking if the cell is closer to the nearest 0. The distance is the absolute difference between the cell and the nearest 0.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of this distance, we need to check if the cell is the nearest 0 in the matrix. If so, we must find the distance between the cell and the nearest 0 in the matrix. We can do this by iterating over the cell's index and checking if it is the nearest 0 in the matrix.\n\nOnce we have calculated the distance between the cell and the nearest 0, we can assign the value of the cell to the matrix index that has the smallest distance.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef manhattan_distance(matrix, cell):\n    min_dist = float('inf')\n    pos_index = None",
