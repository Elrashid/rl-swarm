          "To simplify a fraction to its lowest terms, we need to perform two sub-steps: 2-step multiplication and reducing multiple-term fractions.\n\n**Step 1: 2-step multiplication**\nLet $a$ be the numerator and $b$ be the denominator, andThe Step 1\nStatement: Multiply the numerator and the denominator to form a new fraction $a / b$. So we provided $416$ and $1612$ as the numerator.\nCombining the steps, we got $4532$ as a fraction $4532 / 1612 = 11$ as the final simplified fraction.\n\n**Step 2: Reducing multiple-term fractions**\nIn a multiple-term fraction, the last term is often simplified. This is because it may have a coefficient of 1. To simplify such a fraction, we can simplify the terms of the function. For multi-term fractions, the function is applied to multiples of the common factors.\n\nLet $a = 4532$, $b = 11$, and $\\frac{b}{a}$ be the composite function:\n$a / b = \\frac{4",
          "To simplify a fraction, we need to cancel out as many common factors as possible. In this case, the denominators of $1612$ and $416$ are equal, so we can simplify $1612$ using long division with countdown. At the end of the long division, we'll have a single common factor of 8. Therefore, we can factor $1612$ using the following steps:\n\n1. City 1 & 2, City 1 & 1 & 2, City 1 & 3 & 4, etc.\n2. Then, we can work our way through if-else statements:\n\t* If City 1 comes first, we can factor city 1: City 1 = City 1 & 2 & 4 = $4$\n\t* If City 2 comes first, we can factor city 1: City 1 = City 1 & 2 & 4 = $4$\n\t* Otherwise, if we reach the end of each city, we can factor city 2: City 2 = City 1 & 2 & 4 = $4$\n\nThe final answer will be the following:",

The given fraction is $\\frac{416}{1612}$.\nWe can use the ratio of the numerator and denominator to simplify the fraction. Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by a common factor will eliminate the common factor not shared by the numerator and denominator.\nThe common factors of 416 and 1612 are 4 and 28, so the numerator and denominator of the fraction can be simplified by distributing the 4 by each of these factors, leaving behind a common factor:\n$\\frac{416 \\times \\dfrac{18}{28}}{1612 \\times \\dfrac{7}{28}}$\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{36}{28}$\n#### Expert Solution\nHere is a crude solution for an example:\n\nf = $\\frac{250}{4 \\times 3 \\times 11} \\implies f = \\frac{12 }{3}$\n\nIn brief, this is the non-intuitive part.

The easiest way to simplify a fraction is to multiply the numerator and denominator by the power of 10 that is equal to the reciprocal of the numerator.\n\nHere's the simplification process:\n\nStart by expressing the numerator and denominator as decimals, then determine the power of 10 that is equal to the reciprocal of the numerator.\n\nHere are examples:\n\n* 1/2 = 0.5 (because 2 is a power of 10)\n* 360/2600 = 0.17618299583269598 (the reciprocal of 360 is 1 microseconds over 2600 milliseconds)\n\nThe power of 10 is 1.7618299583269598.
