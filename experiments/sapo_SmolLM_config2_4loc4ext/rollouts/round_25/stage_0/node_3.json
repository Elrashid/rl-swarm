          "Let's simplify the fraction 252/1188 first. The lowest common multiple (LCM) of 252 and 1188 is 1188, so we can divide both numerator and denominator by 1188. According to the LCM, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator is 1184. Since 1184 is also a divisor of both the numerator and denominator, we can simplify the fraction to 1184/1188.\n\nSimplifying the fraction 1184/1188, we get:\n1184 / 1188 = 13/1\nSince the GCD of 1184 and 1188 is 1184, we can eliminate the fraction part and divide numerator by 1184 and denominator by 1188.Now, we can simplify it:\n1184 1/1184 = 9/1\nThe simplified fraction 9/1 is the final answer.",
          "To simplify the fraction 252/1188, we can split it into the numerator and denominator of a multiple of 252 and 1188 respectively. This can be done by dividing the denominator by the numerator twice, so the denominator becomes 6 and the numerator becomes 2.\n\nThe fraction 252/1188 can be written as 252/6 (multiplicative property). \n35/6 (fractional part) can be simplified by adding 7/6: \n35/6 + 7/6 \u2248 37/6 (cuberoot = 3.94)\nThe denominator becomes 688. \n\n252 can be written as 252/1064 (multiplicative property). \n1064/6 = 142.0002 (fractional part) can be changed to 142/142 and simplified as 1/2. \n252/1188 can be written as 252/6 + 1/2 = 252/6 + 3/2 = 25",
          "Simplify the fraction 252/1188 to its lowest terms by cancelling out the common factors, and expressing the numerator and denominator as a common multiple.\n\nAfter cancelling out the factors, we can express the numerator and denominator as a common multiple: the numerator is 252 and the denominator is 1188.\n\n#### 252 is multiplied by 1, and 1188 by 0 leaving 1188, eliminating 252.\n\nUsing the example of 12/6, we can see that, after simplifying, the numerator is 2 and the denominator is the same. Therefore, we can immediately conclude that the answer is 12/6.",
          "Simplifying the fraction goes way more smoothly than I expected. For a fraction with no decimals, just express it in the simplest form. Let's do it.\n\nFirst, multiply both numerator and denominator by 252 to get 252/1188. The denominator already has no decimal place, so it can be kept as 1188. Now, we can multiply both numerator and denominator by 1 to get 252/264.\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 252/1188 = (252*1)/(264*1) = 9/86.\n\nSay you want to round off 252/1188 to the nearest whole number, so let's round to 2.\n\nSince 9/86 is exactly halfway between 2 and 3, so we can round 2 to a very optimistic value. We can even assign a very optimistic value to it without reducing it further.\n\nSo, 252/1188 = 22. That means the answer is 2.\n\nBy simplifying, we get the fraction of $1.",

The partial weekday name December 15, 2022 is May 2, 2023, the second day of the 21st weekday of the year 2023.\n\nBased on the provided information, May 2, 2023, is the day of the week that is two Sundays up to that time (i.e., May 2, which is out of the September 15.

          "To write out the full weekday name of May 2, 2023, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Day of the Week**\nThe first step is to identify the day of the week. In the given input, may 2 is a day of the week. To determine the day of the week, we can use the `weekday` function from the datetime library. This function takes the year as an argument and returns a `datetime.date()` object representing the day of the week.\n\nWe can assign the 2nd day of the month (unless it is a Friday, then it would be `29`), so we can use the date structure `datetime.date()` to create a `datetime` object.\n\nBecause May 2 is a Sunday, let's assign this datetime object to the `datetime2` variable. This would create a `datetime2` object representing the same date as the input.\n\n**Step 2: Format the DAY Award**\nIn order to format the `datetime2` object, we need to wrap it with a date parser object. We can use the `datetime.date()` function to create a `datetime` object",

It is derived from the WOODTHROUGHS DAY, which is a contraction of the Ancient English language.\n\nIt is also possible to calculate the full weekday name by using the full weekdays in a specific order. For example, the year 2023, a weekday, is the weekdays between 2023-05-01 and 2023-06-01 (February 1 to 6). Using the full weekdays in this order, it would be the 25th to 27th weekdays in the current year.\n\nHere are the full weekday names:\n\n* 2023-05-01 - Monday\n* 2023-05-09 - Tuesday\n* 2023-05-16 - Wednesday\n* 2023-05-23 - Thursday\n* 2023-06-01 - Friday\n* 2023-06-08 - Saturday\n* 2023",
