          "To simplify the fraction 4560/9025, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 4560 and 9025. The GCF of 4560 and 9025 is 4560. Since we want to find the largest common factor, we will subtract 4560 from both the numerator and the denominator to obtain the reduced fraction. This is 4560 - 4560 = 156.\n\nThe reduced fraction is then simplified by dividing each term by the LCM of the numerator and denominator.

          "It's a good idea to consider equivalent fractions and how to simplify them before applying the rule.\n\nTo simplify a fraction to its lowest terms, you need to find the GCD (greatest common divisor) of the numerator and denominator. Then, you can divide the numerator by the denominator to get the quotient and several instances of the divisor. Repeat this process until the denominator is 0.\n\nIn this problem, the numerator is 4560, and the denominator is 9025. Therefore, the GCD of 4560 and 9025 is 5. Now we can divide both numerator and denominator by 5. This will give us two new fractions: 0.25 \u00d7 5/9025 and 3/9025.\n\nNow we have (25 \u00d7 5)/125, which gives us (1/3)/9025, which we already mentioned, which simplifies to:\n\n25/125 = 1/3//9025\n\nSo the final answer is 1/3__9025.\nHere's how the formula would:\n\n3 = (1",
          "by long division, we get a integer part: 4560, remainder 60. Since our task requires us to express 4560 as a common multiple of 10 and 9 times, we use long division to make it easier to express the numerator and denominator as common numbers. To begin with, we can use the dividend, 4560, to get the remainder as 0, which represents the 0-place term. We will repeat this process repeatedly to extend the remainder over the 8-place divisor. On each iteration of the loop, we subtract the minimal divisor from the dividend, which produces the next common multiple of the dividend and the divisor. For example, when dividing 4560 by 10, the remainder is subtracted from 4560, which gives us the next common multiple of 10 and 1. These additional composite numbers will yield the input and the handling for all the expanded form(s) of the final product. Therefore, we can compute the sum of these functions using long division and then expand the result.\n\nOn the contrary, to express 9025 as common multiple of 10 and 9,",

These are the variables of the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the operations required**\nTo compute them, we can perform multiplication between `-7` and `4` and subtraction.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the operations**\n`-4` + `-7` = `-13`; and `-4` - `-7` = `-2`\nNote that `-2` is subtracted from `-13` to arrive at `-7`, and `2` is subtracted from it to arrive at `-4`. rationale: 2 subtracted from 4 gives us `-2`, which is the answer to the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Write the final answer**\nThe final answer is `-7` and `-2`.
