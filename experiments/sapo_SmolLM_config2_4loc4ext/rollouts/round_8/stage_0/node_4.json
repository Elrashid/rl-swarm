Split each digit in the number into its digits based on the remained digits of the base-12.\n3. Check whether the base-12-digit string is an integer or not.\n4. Convert the string to an integer with the binomial coefficient algorithm.\n5. Concatenate the integer to the power of the digits and convert the result back to the given base-10.\n\nHere's the Python implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef oct_power(base: int, power: int) -> int:\n    if power > 10:\n        if power < 26:\n            base = 10\n        if base < 9:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid base.\")\n    return (len(str(base)) - 1) * (base ** power)\n\ndef oct_to_base10(oct: str, target_base: int) -> int:\n    if len(oct) < target_base:\n        raise ValueError(\"Oct's length is not",
          "[base: 10 [100]]\n[base: 11 [1111]]\n\nYour code should pass the following assertions:\n```python\nassert str_to_base(61b) == 61\nassert str_to_base(61b) == 61\nassert str_to_base(10j) == 10\n```",
          "To convert a number between two different bases, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide the number of digits in the number by the number of digits in the target base.\n2. Multiply the result by the numeral values for each digit using its corresponding numeral above base 10.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how to implement the conversion:\n\n**Base 10 to Base 6**: The first step is to divide the number of digits in the number by the number of digits in base 10. This division amount is the number of digits in the target base.\n\n6 = 10^0 + 10^1 + 10^2 +...\n10^0 = 1\n10^1 = 5\n10^2 = 12\n10^3 = 36\n10^4 = 49\n10^5 = 62\n10^6 = 72\n10^7 = 80\n10^8 = 92\n10^9 = 99\n10^10 = 100\n\nThe total number",
          "To convert a number between two different bases, you can follow these steps:\n\nInput: A number in any given base.\nOutput: A number in the same base.\n\nFor example, converting a 6-digit base number from exponent 8 to decimal requires:\n- Subtracting the base number from 1000\n- Subtracting the base number from 100\n- Subtracting the base number from 10\n* Subtracting the base number from 10 means subtracting the base number from 1000.\n* Subtracting the base number from 10 means subtracting the base number from 10.\n* Subtracting the base number from 10 means subtracting the base number from 10.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nInput: 61b\nOutput: 48a\n\nExplanation: 61b is equal to 48.\n\nInput: 11b\nOutput: 66a\n\nExplanation: 11b is equal to 66, which is equivalent to 48.\n\nInput: 9ab\nOutput: 5b\n\nExplanation"

          "To solve this problem, we can extract the data from the input matrix, extract the row and col index, and check if each cell is 0, store the index of the minimum distance (closest distance), and calculate the distance to the nearest 0. The returned matrix will be the maximum distance from each cell to the nearest 0.\n\nFor the Jupyter notebook, here is an example solution:\n\n```python\ndef nearest_to_zero_distance(matrix):\n    distance_matrix = []\n    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):\n        for j, value in enumerate(row):\n            if value == 0 or i == 0 or j == 0:\n                distance_matrix.append((i, j, abs(matrix.index(value) - i)))\n\n    return distance_matrix\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n- The `row_index` and `col_index` variables store the row and column index of the cell.\n- The `matrix` variable is the input matrix.\n- The `distance_matrix` variable stores the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell.\n- The `nearest_to_zero_distance` function takes the matrix as input.",
          "To find the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell, we need to understand how the Manhattan distance formula is derived.\n\nThe Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of the absolute values of the row and column variables of an array. It's defined as:\n\nM = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|\n\nIn the case of an array of 0 objects, each object has only one coordinate, or `1`. The Manhattan distance formula becomes `M = 0`, meaning there is no distance between the 0 object.\n\nNow, let's say we want to find the distance to the nearest 0 in rows of size `N` and columns of size `K`, where `N` is the number of rows and `K` is the number of columns.\n\nTo calculate the distance to an 0, we first consider the row coordinates. We can use the `row` coefficient of the 0 object in the array as the row of distance. By using the KEEP operator, we can efficiently access the distance to the row.\n\nThe `row` coefficient of an 0 object can be calculated as `= (row"
