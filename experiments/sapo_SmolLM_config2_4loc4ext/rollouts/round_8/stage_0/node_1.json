Calculate the Manhattan distance between each cell individually: This is done by subtracting the sum of the column values from the sum of the row values, which is defined as the Manhattan distance between two cells.\n\n2. Create an array to store the Manhattan distances: You can represent each cell as a placeholder, and then calculate the Manhattan distance for each cell.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef manhattan_distance(c1, c2):\n    return abs(c1.x - c2.x) + abs(c1.y - c2.y) - 2 * math.sqrt(max(c1.x, c2.x, c1.y, c2.y))\n\ndef find_nearest_manhattan_distance(matrix):\n    squared_dist = [manhattan_distance(row, c) for row in matrix]\n    distances = [squared_dist[idx] + 1 for idx in range(len(squared_dist))]\n    return distances\n```",

It iterates through each cell in the matrix and computes the distance using the Manhattan distance formula. The nearest 0 is created by subtracting the distance to the cell from 0 and setting the value to 0 if it's greater than 0. The distances are then stored in a separate list and returned.",

If no score for the given cell exists, the nearest 0 position must be the position of the None value in the result of the Manhattan distance algorithm. If the scoring row or column is empty, the nearest 0 position will be null.",

It then uses this orientation to ensure that the correct directions are used for distances. For each cell, the function calculates the nearest zero in each direction and adds the distance to that direction in the output\\_matrix."
