          "The question requires me to make a lot of assumptions and deduce the answer given a set of statements that involve logical operations. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Let's assume the \"Q\" node, which represents \"Either\" or \"and\", since answer 1 implies \"by implication\" (By Eucaresus) implies \"implying\" (Q -> Q).\n2. **Implication**: The if-then statement is \"if P is True, then Q. The first sentence assumes that \"If P is True, then P\". If P is true, then we can infer that P is false, but by rule 2 of the first implicit inference rule, we can conclude that P is true, even if P is false. This means that if P is true, then Q must be true.\n3. **Contrition**: Then, let's assume \"Q\" is not true. The second sentence doesn't specify that \"if Q is true, then Q\". Therefore it should be concluded that Q doesn't exist.\n4. The start of answer 2, which does not follow the rule 2 of the first implicit inference rule, implies that Q must not exist. This means that if Q is not true",
