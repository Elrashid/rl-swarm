This results in the numbers changing and the fraction is no longer in its lowest terms. 29 is more than 7 division.\n\nSince 7 is a factor, we cannot divide 7 evenly. 329 cannot be divided by 7, so we cannot add zero to the decimal number.\n\nWe can also divide 329 by 427 to get 0.77,, so we see that the matching number is 7.

          "Step-by-step process to simplify the fraction:\n\n1. Factor trinomials: Factor the top-left element of the fraction, 329, to find its prime factors: 3, 2, 9, 3, 2, 3.\n2. Factor out 3: Multiply both sides by 3.\n3. Simplify the expression: Divide the numerator and denominator by 2, then simplify: unique value of 3.\n\nStep 2: By the factor theory, (3\u00b2)\u00b2*2\u00b2 = 9, which is a perfect square.\n\nStep 3: Since we've already factored 3, 427(3,2,3) = 135, which is also a perfect square.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the simplification is 329/427 = 9/135.\n\nSimplified simplified form:\n\n329/427 = 9/135\n\nExample mathematics problem:\n\n1264 \u00f7 675 = 11/1264 = 1/768\nDo you understand",
          "For the simplified fraction, the easiest way to approach this is by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Dividing 329 by 427 will give us our final answer, which is 0.777. This is indeed a simplified fraction, and we will get it as a result.\n\nRemember to keep the fraction for each fraction element the same. In this example, we have 329/427, so we can treat it as 271/427 for this simplification.\n\nChecks: Check that the result is equivalent to the actual fraction. Please try converting numerator and denominator to integers. For example, split the numerator into two whole numbers (271 as an integer) and divide the denominator by 4. Then, subtract 271 from both numbers to get 269 as an integer. The difference can be appended to the numerator, and the equation becomes:\n\n271/427 = (269 - 271)/427\n\nThis simplifies further to (137/427), and so on. Finally, we get:\n\n271/427 = (137"
