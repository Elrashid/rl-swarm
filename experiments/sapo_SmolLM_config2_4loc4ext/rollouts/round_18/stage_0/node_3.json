          "As per the problem statement, we need to round up the final answer to a maximum of 5 significant digits.\nSince the value is greater than 9.537 and less than 10.016, we need to round up.\n\nThere are several ways to round up a value to a maximum of 5 significant digits, depending on the rounding mode.\nOne option is to use a fixed-point rounding mode called \"truncated\" rounding mode. In this mode, the final output is truncated to the specified number of significant digits and the number of 0's is discarded. In this case, the truncation should be to 0.\n\nThe `round()` function in Python returns a floating-point number, so we need to convert it to an unsigned integer. By first allocating the desired number of unsigned integers in bit 3 of the floating-point number, we can use the `>>` and `<<` operators to modify the unsigned integer from the least significant digit to the next bit and from the next bit to the fourth bit, respectively. This gives us a locked only value for the floating-point number.\n\n```python\ndef truncate_to_five_places(data",

The `exact` tag is a string containing any sequence of digits that is exactly 10 with no leading or trailing zeros.\n2. We divide the provided formula string by 188.8.131.52 to get the quotient. This division operation is possible because `int(184/9.85)` is greater than or equal to `1.6307`.\n3. We get the next integer quotient by rounding the quotient to the nearest integer after it appears in the supplied formula. This integer is 1.3.\n4. We further subtract the rounded integer by 1.3 from the quotient to get the result.\n5. We extract the value from the rounded integer by accessing `fib` as a string without quotes",
