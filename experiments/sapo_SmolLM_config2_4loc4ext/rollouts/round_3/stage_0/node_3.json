          "Here's how the rulemation process looked like for the first example:\n\nWe're asked to develop the rule from the given examples.\nFirst, we'll start with the obvious step: map the input grid to the output grid by taking the entries of both grids. In this case, the input grid is a 2D array (4 by 4) and the output grid is also a 2D array with the same dimensions.\n\nThen, we'll define a function to compare the input and output grids, which requires understanding of combination, agreement, and differentiative rules.\n\nFor the first operation, we'll map 4-element-pairs from the input grid to positions in the output grid. In this case, the input grid consists of rows of 4 and the output grid consists of columns of 4. So, we'll take the two elements from each row and add the two elements from each column to get another 2-element pair. Finally, we'll count the number of 0s in the output grid, which will give us the number of possible combinations (0s in 2 rows \u00d7 2 columns).\n\nFor the second operation, we'll map 4-element-pairs from the input",
          "The rule for the given problem can be formulated as follows:\n\n\"Given an input grid \" and \"Output grid\" be built, match the pattern between each pixel and the location of the `x` or `y` coordinate of the next cell in the grid. For example, if `x`-coordinate is `0`, the `y` coordinate `(y+1)` on the next cell should be `x+1`.\n\nHere, the input grid consists of `x`-positions `(0,0)` to `x(28,28)` for the top-left and bottom-right pixels.\n\nThe output grid is formed by `y(52,36)` to `y+16` for the top-right and bottom-left pixels.\n\nThe next rules are extracted from this input list by turning the theorem `\"We must be able to match the 'x' and 'y' coordinates within the next cell\"` into three-tuples of consecutive `y`-positions and `1`-positions. Then, `2` consecutive `y`-positions and `1` consecutive `x`-position are created by `(y+2,y+1",

In today's context, since there is still a week of indefinite duration, we can not assume a fixed reference point.\n\nThat being said, we can use the natural etymological development of the words and the dictionary of days of the week to build our justification. The old Latin \"di\u0113dandas\" in the Longfellow's poem (\"Elladendine maiden queen'd by Eve's longing!\") meant \"Day\" (\u012bdantis in string direction emphasis) and was derived from \"di\u0113s\", \"day\", and \"dansere\" meaning \"to dance\".
