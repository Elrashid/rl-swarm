          "I used a combination of linear algebra and inverse matrix operations to find the correct rule. Given the input grid, I replaced the initial value with 0 and the edges with zero. Next I wanted to find the total sum of each tile in the grid, not just the overall sum, so I also replaced the initial value with 0.\nTo fix the original grid, I first found the positions of each tile in the grid using elementary row operations. Then, I transformed the original graph back into a system of linear equations, which helped me to find the correct rule. Finally, I replaced the first row with zero vectorizing all rows and the first two columns with zero vectors of ordered pairs.\n\nWhen I arrived at the final answer, I thought it would be it but it isn't. The actual output was fairly straightforward, but I couldn't quite explain how I arrived at the final answer. I solved these two steps: finding the correct rule and getting the correct output grid back.\n\nThis problem isn't as straightforward as it looks, but I think it follows the same general pattern. The area of the grid is determined by the length of the rows and the width of the columns and the extra information I provided was helpful in solving the problem.\n\n",

The first input step is to convert the input grid into the checkerboard pattern:\n\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 etc.\n\nThe next step is to spread the rows and columns of the input grid to the output grid, each row using a binary pattern of 0s and 1s. The next step is to match the input grid against the output grid to obtain the output grid.\n\nThe final step is to return only the output grid itself, without any extra information on any of the input grid rows or columns.\n\nHere's a possible code snippet that implements the rule:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule(grid):\n    output_grid =",

After importing the required library, we can load the maze as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a cell in the maze. We can then use a nested loop to iterate through each group of cells and apply the rule to each cell, converting the iteration to check validity and add the maze to the output grid. We can return the output grid as the final result in the example output.\n\nFollowing the given instruction, you can create the test input grid by passing it to the function. We can then check if the input grid is valid, using the condition `is_valid_section_range(row_1, row_2, col_1, col_2)` to check if the grid contains valid cells. If the input grid is valid, we can extract the output grids from the test examples and construct the output grid excluding wall cells. Then, we can return the final output grid as the result.\n\nYou can test your solution with the following test case inputs:\n\n```\ntest_input_grid_0 = [\n    [\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 ",

          "To convert the given number between two different bases, we need to consider the range of numerical values and the rules for converting numbers between different bases.\n\nThe number 3234 should be in base-5 because it has 5 digits and the number 1234 should be in base-6 and it should be negative because the conversion is negative in base-5 and positive in base-6.\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Identify the target base: In this case, the target base is 6, so the base-5 number can be converted to base-6 using the rules mentioned above.\n2. Convert the given number from decimal to decimal: To convert the given decimal number to decimal, we can use the following steps:\n\t* Multiply the decimal part of the given number by 10 to convert it to a decimal number.\n\t* Add the decimal point of the given original number part and the decimal point of the given number part to get the converted number.\n\nHere is the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_base(base, decimal):\n    converted_decimal = decimal * 10 + decimal % 10\n   ",
          "Logic suggests converting the base-5 number 3234 to base-6 using a straightforward process.\n\nSince base-5 and base-6 have the same number of digits each, we can calculate the equivalent value for each base by dividing the value of the base-5 number by the value of 6.\n\nWe start by considering base-5 number 3234 as such. Integer part of 3234 divided by 6 gives an integer value. Integer part of 6 divided by 6 gives a decimal value.\n\nAs decimal value divided by 6 is equal to 3, the value of 4 in base-5 number 3234 is 0's complement. The complement of 0's, along with all its digits (0-9), appear as digits in the reverse of the number (decimal) 190,38. Therefore, the complement of 4 in base-5 number 3234 is 0.\n\nThe complement of bits 4 and 5 in digital number 3234 is an obvious fact. The complement of bit-9 (3) in digital number 3234 is also an obvious fact",
          "We can use the rules of base conversion to convert a number from one base to another.\n\n**1. One-base number conversion:**\n\nLet's start with a base of 7 (base-7) and a number of 3234. The target base is usually between 2 and 16.\n\nTo convert a number from one base to another, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the target base is greater than 10. If it is, return the original value.\n2. If the target base is less than 10, use a different binary representation.\n3. If the target base is greater than 10, use a different octal representation.\n\nFor the example, if we want to convert 3234 to base-6, we can use the following corresponding binary and octal formats:\n\nBin: 01111001\nOct: 10368\n\nThe target base is 6. We can then convert each number to its corresponding binary form and octal form.\n\n**2. Base-5 up to 6 conversion:**\n\nHere's how we can convert a",
          "Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef convert_base(number, base):\n    result = ''\n    while number > 0:\n        digit = number % base\n        result = chr(ord('a') + digit) + result\n        number //= base\n    return result\n```",
          "To convert the number 3234 from base-10 to base-6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the digits of the base-10 number 3234 in base-10. The digits of 3234 are: 3, 2, 3, 4.\n2. Convert each digit to its corresponding base-6 value using the equation.\n\nFor example, the digits of 3234 in base-10 are [3, 2, 3], and in base-6, the corresponding digits are [3, 0, 0]:\n\na: 10\nb: 1\nc: 10\nd: 1\ne: 1\nf: 0\ng: 0.3\nh: 1.3\n\n3. Reassemble the digits of 3234 in base-6 into decimal (using the `+` or round)\n\nTo achieve this, we'll iterate through each digit in base-10 and use the following rules to summarize the value:\n\n* For each digit: The `value` for the digit is its top-priority"
