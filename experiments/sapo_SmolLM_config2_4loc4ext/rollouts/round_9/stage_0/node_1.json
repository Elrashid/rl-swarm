          "The main idea is to convert a number between two different bases. The steps to convert a number in two different bases are as follows:\n\n1. The first step is to determine the base of the number. For example, 11e means 11 plus the power of 10 (e) what is the leading digit of 110 = 1 in base 10.\n2. Then, convert the base to English letters i.e. convert the digits of 110 to the corresponding letters.\n3. Now, convert the base to base 4 using the range of numbers from 0 to 9 (base 10 and 110, respectively). This is done by following the example given in the base 11e formula.\n4. At last, convert the base to base 1 headed.
