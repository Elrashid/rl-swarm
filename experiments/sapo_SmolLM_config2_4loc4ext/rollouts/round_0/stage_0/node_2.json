          "BF code is a programming paradigm in which flow control is not implemented. Instead, loops and conditionals are used to control the execution of the program and to make decisions.\n\nIn a traditional program body, such as this one, command processing and control flow are implemented by function parameters and return values, which are connected by loops and conditional statements. These loops and conditionals are primarily for generating the output of a program.\n\nIn a BF code, besides the loop body, there are no functions that make decisions based on the program's execution. Instead, there is a `.` symbol, which represents the exit point of a loop, with each iteration setting ` suspense.` (or a similar symbol), `{.I}` (or `rt`), `{.LF}` (or `ql`), and so on.\n\nWhen iterating through the code, the symbols involved are inserted into a representation of the loop variable and the statements that make decisions within the loop body. For example, at the end of each loop, the suspensions are added to the `.LF` and `{.LF}` characters. If the loop jumps out of the loop body, it is then destroyed.\n\nAnother",

In this case, we can take the common denominator 464 and divide both numerator and denominator by 464 to get:\n\n29 \u00f7 464 = 0.055\n\nSimplify the fraction $\\frac{29}{464}$:\n\n0.055 Remainder: 0\nThe simplified fraction is 55/464.",
          "Simplifying the fraction $\\frac{29}{464}$ is a bit more challenging than adding terms, but here are the steps I would follow to make it simpler:\n\n1. Distribute the correct numeral over the denominator: In this fraction, the numerator is 29, and the denominator is 464. We can distribute the numeral over the denominator to get: $\\frac{29}{464}$\n2. Multiply the top and bottom by $\\frac{2699}{4211}$: The top and bottom of the fraction can be combined like this: $\\frac{\\frac{29}{464}\\cdot \\frac{2699}{4211}}{\\frac{464}{464}}$\n3. Simplify the fractions: Finally, we can simplify the sum and difference using the first step above: $\\frac{464}{464}+\\frac{2699}{4211}=\\frac{65364}{464}+\\frac{2699}{4211}=2982944 \\cdot \\frac{269",
          "Here's the steps involved in simplifying the fraction:\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the numerator**\n\nThe numerator can be simplified if the denominator is divisible by 3. Since 29 and 464 are both divisible by 3, 29 and 464 can be further divided by 3, making the numerator simplified. The simplified fraction is:\n\n29 / 3 = 9/1\n464 / 3 = 144 / 3\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the denominator**\n\nThe denominator cannot be simplified initially since 29 and 464 are not divisible by 3. However, dividing both numerator and denominator by 3 leaves the numerator and denominator as a simple fraction. The simplified denominator is:\n\n$144/3$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the whole fraction**\n\nThe fraction can now be simplified to its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3 again. The simplified fraction is:\n\n$464/144$\n\n**Step 4: Round to the nearest integer or decimal**\n\nTo read the answer, a decimal should be rounded"
