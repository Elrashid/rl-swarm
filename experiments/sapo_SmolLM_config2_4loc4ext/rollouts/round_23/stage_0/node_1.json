          "I need to determine if the year 1986 is a leap year. To do so, I must consider two criteria:\n1. Whether the year is divisible by 4, which would typically imply that it is a leap year.\n2. To determine whether the year is a leap year, I must consider whether the year is divisible by 100 or not. If it is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year. If it is a multiple of 400, it is a leap year.\n\nBased on the given year, the year 1986 is not divisible by 4, so it is a leap year. This explains why it is not a leap year. The year 1986 is not divisible by 100 or 400. If it was divisible by 100, it would not be a leap year. On the other hand, it is divisible by 400, so it will be a leap year.\n\nBy considering the given year, 1986, the time period that it fits into:\n\n* Year 1986 based on the last day of the month and the last day",
          "(1.1549  and 01 998.1451  are in the third quarter of 1986.) The 1986 calendar year had 3 quarter-years, and the year 1986 had 2 quarter-years left.\nTo determine if the year 1986 is a leap year, we need to check if it is a positive number that is evenly divisible by 4 and 100. The integer part of the year can be obtained using the modulo operator (%). The integer part of a number is zero if the number is a multiple of 9, and the remainder of the integer part is the remainder of the number from keeping consecutive digits.\nSince the last digit in the modulo operation is zero, we can conclude that the whole integer part of the year is also divisible by 100. Therefore, it is a leap year and we are allowed to write ETLDcltags around it.\nFollowing below are the parsed tags and the actual tags associated with etdcl tag:\nETLD doctrinal marker code\nETLD cause page\nETLD thematic marker code\nETLD systemic design marker...\nThe above tags are",

          "The correct answer is yes. The year 1986 is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nTo determine if a year is a leap year, we need to check if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100. It should also be divisible by 400, as the year 1980 was a leap year.\n\nHere's how we can determine if 1986 is a leap year:\n\nFirst, check if it is divisible by 4, and since it is divisible by 4, it is divisible by 400 as well. This condition is fulfilled for:\n\n4, 60, 120, 100, 140, 160, 180, 200, 240, 280, 320, 360\n\nIn 1986, 4, 12, 16, 20, and 24 are divisible by 4, so it is divisible by 400.

Today, it is 5,686,456,958 seconds, which is equivalent to 8,301 hours 40 minutes 7.5375 seconds (4 hours 40 minutes, 7.5375 seconds). This means that it has 269 more leap years than ordinary years.\n\nLooking for a year that is divisible by 4 and not a century, we can start from any number that is divisible by 4, then divide the remaining number by 2, and check if the remainder is 0.\n\nSince 1986 comes after 4713 BCE, it is likely to be divisible by 4. However, it is not a century year as the total number of leap years after 1986 is 18.

If you find a month and date that does not meet this criterion, then yes, a leap year is indeed present.\n\nIf you want to check if a year is also",
          "A straightforward answer! In any year divisible by 4, but not 100, it is a leap year. Therefore, the year 1986 is a leap year.\n\nFor more information, read on:\n\n**Explanation of logic:**\nThe problem asks us to determine if the year 1986 is a leap year. We can determine the year's structure to be divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100. To achieve this, we divide the year by 4 (i.e., 1986 divided by 4 equals 468) to find out if it is a multiple of 4. Since it is a multiple of 4, we can assume that it is a leap year.\n\nTo check if it is divisible by 4, we simply check if it divides evenly by 4 (i.e., 4 is not divisible). As stated earlier, it is not divisible by 100. Therefore, it is a leap year, and we can conclude that it is divisible by either 4 or 100. For the step, we focus on the case where 1986 is divisible by 4 and not divisible by",

In this case, we can break the problem into smaller steps and identify the key rules and principles that map an input grid to an output grid.\n\nA review of the input grid will help us understand the size and boundaries of the system. A good size and boundary for an input grid computation is at least 5x5 or 8x8. This ensures that the computation can take place consistently and iteratively.\n\nInput:\n5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n5 5 5 5 5 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe input grid contains a large number of elements, with no dropout or compacting anywhere in the input grid.

For example, there is one rule that handles the displacement and the rule that manages the right-left coordinate, as shown in the following equation:\n\nWhere N is an integer, K is an integer, S is an integer, D is an integer, R is an integer, and shows the destination coordinates of N(3-4) equals S.\n\nWe can derive the rule for the output grid by remembering the input who migrates coordinates: src, dst, and right. We can work in different steps only for the different operations:\n       1. multiply src and destination puts src at the translation source coordinates D (according to rule 1)\n       2. multiply src and destination puts src at the translation destination coordinates S (according to rule 2)\n       3. right",

The solution is: 2 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 8.\n\nThe heuristic for this problem is to identify the grid positions where we can place the values of 1 to 9 and then follow the common diagonals from those positions to create the rest of the grid. Diego's variables are helpful in this process by providing possible values for the initial position. As",
          "We have  following steps to follow for solving this example:\n\n1.

Fill in the function `get_formatted_grid` to list the formatted rows and columns of the grid according to the given rectangular cell conditions, given the width of the input grid.\n4. Write the function `print_grid` that takes a grid string and prints the formatted rows, columns",

The back cells for each column will also be `1` since they are overlapped by the front cells.\n- We'll shift the rows to the left by 1 and add `5` to each cell.\n- For the last row and colum, we'll add `0`, `0`, `0`, `5`, `3`, `0`, `0`, `3`, `0`, `0`, `0`, and `2` since all the numbers are swapped.\n\nHere is the code that implements this:\n\n```python\ndef solve_grid(grid):\n    if not isinstance(grid, tuple):\n        raise TypeError('Invalid input: the input must be a tensor')\n\n    num_rows, num_cols = grid.size()\n    result = [[1 for _ in range(num_rows)] for _ in range(num_cols)]\n    padding_width = max(num_rows - 1, num_cols - 1)\n   "
