Network theory theory and real analysis theory together, suffice the challenge.\nLet's take a closer look at the instruction and see how to apply the rules of modulus difference and rounding.\nIn this problem, we need to find the difference between two quantities, `a` and `b`, with `a` having a value of 2.16 and `b` having a value of `6.3*1.385`.\nWith the first two premises, we can simplify the division:\n`2.16 = 2.8`\n`6.3*1.385 = 7`\n`a = 2.8 + 7 = 3.5`\nTherefore, the difference between `a` and `b` is `3.5 * 2.16 = 6.63`.\nTo round this to 5 significant digits, I will use precision numbers in scientific notation to represent the result. For example, I will round the fractional part to `8` from 3.5.\n`6.63` = 6.63\nThis is a rounded value",
