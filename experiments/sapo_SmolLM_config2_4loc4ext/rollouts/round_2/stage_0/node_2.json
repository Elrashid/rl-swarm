To respond to the second example, you can multiply the cells in the horizontal and vertical directions 8 and add 6, which offsets the remaining cells in the grid to the right and to the left. To respond to the third example, you can multiply the cells in the horizontal and vertical directions 0 and add 10, which overlaps the forward firing setting and the smoosh setting. To respond to the fourth example, you can subtract 2 from the horizontal and vertical directions, which halves the grid when calculating the next direction. To respond to the fifth example, you can multiply the cells in the horizontal and vertical directions by 2, which copies the forward firing property and reduces the grid relatively smoothly.

          "Here's how I would apply the problem-solving process to solve the example 1 and 2 example:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nI understand that this is a layout of numbers in a grid, where each number can only be 0 or 1.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the input and output parameters**\nIn this problem, the input is a 8x8 grid with some numbers in 0's and 1's. The output is a 4x4 grid where each number is in the correct position.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the grid structure**\nThe grid has a total of 4 rows and 4 columns, which means it has 6 rows \u00d7 6 columns. Each row and column can only hold 0s or 1s, so there are 8 possible moves for the 8 numbers in the grid.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the rule**\nThe rule is \"move the number to the row and column that has the number of ones (`O`) and ones (`1`) in the current row if the number is greater than zero (`x`), or `1` otherwise.\" This means that the first move would be the number",
          "Remember that the input to the rule generator is a 2-dimensional grid, representing the input grid. Once the rule generator is run, the generator will return a rule for the output grid, which is 2-dimensional.\n\nHere's how you can implement the rule generator in Python:\n\n```python\ndef generate_output_grid(input_grid):\n    tuple_grid = [(0, 0, input_grid[0][0], input_grid[0][1], input_grid[0][2])]\n    for row in input_grid:\n        row_state = (0, 0, tuple(x for x in row if1}_{1} for x in block_grid)\n        result_grid = generate_grid(row_state)\n        for i, block in enumerate(block_grid):\n            result_grid[i][::3] = np.homogeneous_array(result_grid[i][::3])\n    return result_grid\n\ndef generate_grid(state):\n    block_grid = state[0]\n    bed_grid = state[1]\n    ternary_state = (thus_run(block_grid), again)\n    return generate_output",
          "Certainly! We can apply the given rule and concept:\n\nThe rule states that the sum of the numbers in the given grid is equal to the sum of the numbers five cells beyond the grid.\nTherefore, to solve this problem, we'll need to keep track of the total sum of all the numbers in the given grid, which will be equal to the sum of all the numbers five cells beyond the grid. We'll then calculate the sum of the numbers five cells beyond the grid by adding the current number in the grid and adjusting it based on the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nHere's how you can apply the rule and concept in order to solve the problem:\n\nStep 1: Iterate through the given grid and keep track of the number of cells four by four diagonals ahead. Use the target number of cells four by four diagonals ahead for the M\u00f6bius strip wrapping that extends from the grid cell to the bottom edge.\n\nStep 2: Initialize the number of cells four by four diagonals forward for the first M\u00f6bius strip. Then, if the current number of cells four by four diagonals forward is 4, update the value of the first M\u00f6bius strip to 5.\n\nStep 3: Add",
