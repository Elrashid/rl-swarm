We can do this by repeatedly subtracting the lower base from the higher base until the difference becomes zero. At each step, we find the corresponding digit in the product of the smaller base and the larger base.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n```python\ndef convert_number(number, base):\n    digit_count = 0\n    num = 0\n\n    while number > 0:\n        digit = number & (base - 1)\n        number >>= 1\n        num += 1\n        digit_count += 1\n\n    return key(digit_count, base)\n\n\ndef key(n, b):\n    digit_base = convert_number(n, b)\n    return b.chars[n] + digit_base\n```",

For example, the base-10 number 100200 corresponds to the 10^3 in the target-based system. To convert this 10^3, we need to know the number of 10s in the target-based system.

          "Here are the solutions:\n\n**Weekly frequency of weekends:**\n\nNumber of weekend days is the number of days in the week minus the number of weekdays, divided by 7. Since Saturday is considered a weekday, the total weekend days would be 20 - 7 = 13. The answer is 13.\n\n**Weekfall:**\n\nIf anywhere on Earth, seven days in a week, you can effortlessly get 13 whole weekend days. However, it's more unusual to get 24 big weekend days. So, 13 day works. The next two weeks are also amazing, and 13 extra weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) added up to 25. Let's learn more about these two extra days and how they work.\n\n**How do these extra days work:**\n\nThese extra two days are because each week belongs to exactly two full months. This means that forty days in the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) are shared between the two sharing periods, and (Monday, Tuesday) is shared also. These extra days are called out with a single letter \"_",

This approach is reasonable, as we have 25 days between February 10 and 28 of each month. So, we can consider the numbers from 2023-02-19 to 2023-02-25 as examples.\n\nHere is the calculation:\n\n1.
