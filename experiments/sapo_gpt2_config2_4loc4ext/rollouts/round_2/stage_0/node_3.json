Some of the aspects of your first draft input file come from sources beyond this template. The output file can be modified and designed as you care to think in your own model. Imagine a reasonably small group of students tossing down two ideas for printing, starting with a method that would eliminate 2fast_strike shacks at work before we printed them one round at a time. Why not now? Visual studio do the very same thing very quickly, working towards three quick ideas grounded on a sense of danger and submission.
