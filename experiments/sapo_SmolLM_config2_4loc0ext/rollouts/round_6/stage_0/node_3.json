Identify the conclusion: By definition, the conclusion of the first set of premises is: `\u2295` = (\u2227) \u2227 \u2227 (conversion) = (\u2227) \u2227 (\u25a1) = \u00ac.\n4. Solve the problem: Notice that `\u2227` and `\u25a1` have the same sense of disjunction and negation. Therefore, if our conclusion satisfies `\u2227` ensures that the premises satisfy both `\u25a1` and `\u00ac` by definition.\n\nSo, conclusion:\n\"According to the above premises, we conclude that (P \u2227 Q) \u2295 ((P \u2227 P) \u2227 (P \u2192 P)) \u2192 ((P \u2227 P) \u2227 (P \u2192 P)).\"\n\nHere is the predicted answer:\n#### 1.

Apply the rule found in step 2 to each row or column, and then use the output of each rule to create the output for the remaining columns and rows.\n\nThe input grid is represented by the following matrix:\n```\nrow 1\n   | 0 6 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\nThe output grid can be represented as a 3x3 matrix:\n```\narray([[0, 0, 6],\n       [0, 1, 2],\n       [2, 1, 2]\n])\n```\nYou can see from the expected solution that the",
          "Here is an example of how you could apply the rule to the sample input:\n\nBased on the input, the brain would likely use the following rule:\n\nInput -> Output\n   Input: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 4 4 4 0 0 0\n   Use the 0's as characters and the 5's as numbers.\n   i.e. 0 0 2 1 1 0 0\n   would extract and combine the numeric values.\n   Then, the brain would shift the right number of spaces to indicate the output.\n   So in this example, we would get:\n   Input:\n  0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   Input:\n  0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output would be:\n0 0 4 3  5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   Output:\n  0 0 0 0    | 9\n  0 0 0  1 0 1   ",
          "The input grid appears as follows:\n\n```\n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe rule that maps an input grid to an output grid is that each 2x2 block must be equal in rows and columns. This rule can be derived by combining the following equations, and then rearranging the equations to simplify them:\n\nInitial guess:\n\n```\n 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 2\n```\n\nInitial steps:\n\n1. Add 2x2 cells to the output grid to ensure the rows and columns are equal.\n2. Multiply the entire row by 2.\n3. Add 1 to the output grid to account for the first 2x2 cells added.\n4. Multiply the output grid by 4 to get",
          "For example, the rules of the conversion above would be:\n\n1. Without using loops: `0 7 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 0 7 4 9 0 0 0 0` -> 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2. Without using a function: `0 7 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 0 7 4 9 0 0 0 0` -> 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe typical time complexity of input processing under these rules is $O(m x n)$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns in the input grid.",
          "The problem presents a grid of 3 x 3 boxes, where each box has a given number. The output grid should contain the same number of boxes filled in, but one space should be missing from the grid. The missing space contains a number 0. Obtain the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, and describe your reasoning process and how you derived the rule using mathematical statements.\n\nThe input grid, given the input values, is:\n\n0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n=> Each box must contain at least one element (0, 7, 7, 5)\n\nThe output grid, given the output-matching number of spaces in each box, is:\n\n0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n=> The same number is in each box\n\nAssuming that the grid is fully filled with 0s and no 1s, any number can be written as 0 + 0 = 0 in any case.\n\n0 5 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 "
