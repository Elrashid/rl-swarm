          "0/100 correct! 2038 is not a leap year, which is relevant to the question. Here's a breakdown of the rules involved:\n\n**Centennial Year (Known as an Intercalary Year) or a Cyclical Year:**\n\n2038 is not a leap year because it has 3652 lunations, not 3652 days. This is a natural progression of the human calendar, with 365 lunations in a year. While there are 4 cycles (365, 366, 367, and 368) in the solar calendar, 2038 is not a leap year because it has an additional 24-day cycle.\n\n**Main reasons for not being a leap year:**\n\n1. **Proper use of months with 29 days:** In 2038, because 365 is too short a year, the calendar has to use cycle days (leap days) and vice versa. Comparing the calendar to the Earth's celestial cycles, we know that the extra day is needed to keep the relationship between the Earth's year and the solar year square.\n\n**General",
          "Before we dive into the details, let me clarify that the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines a leap year as one that occurs every four years, where the last day of the year is not a common multiple of 4. There are three main types of leap years:\n\n**Leap year with a Easter or Halloween date:**\nIn a calendar year that starts on or after March 20, the last day of the year is divisible by 100, but not divisible by 400. This means a year ending in 2000, 2100, 2200, 2400, or 2700 wouldn't necessarily need to be a leap year.\n\nIn a calendar year starting on or after March 20, the last day of the year is not a common multiple of 400. However, in all other years after 2903, 2905, 2907, 2908, and 2911, the last day of the year is not divisible by 4, but it is a common multiple of 100.\n\n**Leap year with an",
          "A question about time zone differences!\n\nUnfortunately, 2038 is a leap year in the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) Timestamp (2038-03-01T00:00:00). The IERS time zone offset is UTC-5.\n\nAs a result, 2038 will not be a leap year, but it will be a supermoon.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of different calendar systems:\n\n**4700 CE (BALICE)**\n**Super Jupiter Spectacular Evening Star**: The supermoon fall on the night of March 13-14, 2038, at 22:42:10 UTC. It's the second supermoon of this year.\n\n**Vatnaj\u00f6kull National Park, Iceland - Refugees from 28 Villages Afoot Due to Plight of Miskruten**\nYou might be thinking that this sky sight opportunity is a rare chance to work outdoors with minimal structure. However, it's not uncommon for volunteers to be deployed in remote areas during natural disasters or humanitarian crises.\n\n**Catholic Church Officials Exposed",
          "To determine whether 2038 is a leap year, let's explore the definition of a leap year.\n\n**What is a leap year?**\nA leap year is an additional day added to the calendar to make up for the number of days in a year that are not divisible by 7. To determine whether a year is a leap year or not, we add an extra day (February 29th) to the end of February in the previous year.\n\n**2038 and 2039:**\nTo verify if 2038 is a leap year, we need to determine if there is a day divisible by 7 in February. Let's check the number of days in February in each year:\n\n2037: 29 (February has 29 days)\n2038: 29 (February has 29 days)\n2039: 29 (February has 29 days)\n\nSince 2038 is divisible by 5, there is no leap day in February. 2039 is considered to be a regular year.\n\nNow, if we add an extra day (February 29th",
          "A great topic!\n\nTo answer whether 2038 is a leap year, we can break down the definition and calculate whether it's a leap year or not. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Define a leap year:\nA leap year is a year that has exactly 366 days, rather than the usual 365 days. This means that the extra day is added to the end of the month of February.\n\nStep 2: Count the number of days in February:\nThe number of days in February is 28 if it is a month, and 29 if it is a leap year.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the actual number of days in February:\nIn the last year, 2038, there are 361 days in February.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether February is a leap year or not:\nIf February has 28 days or 29 days, it is a leap year.\n\nStep 5: Check if 2038 is a leap year:\nOn that specific year, February has 28 days. So, February 21 will fall on February 20 (2",
          "According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), 2038 is not a leap year since it is not divisible by 5. Thus, it is not a leap year.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. 2038 is not divisible by 5: The year 2038 ends in a 0, so it cannot be divisible by 5.\n2. It is not a multiple of 10: As the year 2038 is not divisible by 10, it is not divisible by 500 either.\n\nTherefore, 2038 is not a leap year according to the IAU.",
          "No, 2038 is not a leap year, even according to the International Astronomical Union (IAU).\n\nAs of 2022, there is no way to extend the 12-month calendar year in a way that would make it a leap year. The IAU's resolvees to align the Gregorian calendar (used by most of the world) with the Julian calendar (used in some regions) has led some to question whether the idea of a 12-month calendar year could ever be implemented.\n\nIn essence, a leap year has no traditional meaning for a 12-month year. The IAU resolution decades, 1900-1999 are deemed \"good\" but not \"solrim.\" \"Solrim\" is the division of the year into 24 seasons, whereas the good resolution decades are in other eras. It is for this reason that the IAU's resolution explains that \"novus sollicitus\" (new sollicitus) does not constitute a leap year.\n\nSo, is 2038 a leap year? The answer depends on how one defines a \"leap year.\" If you consider a year to be a leap year"

Each cell in the grid contains one of the following settings: `X` for an empty cell, `0` for a blank cell.\n2. Apply the rule: Append each cell setting to a new list.\n3. Find the maximum number of empty cells: To ensure the output grid is empty, we'll compare the length of the list with the input grid size. If the length of the list is greater, we'll add the new cell setting to the grid.\n4.

The input grid has 912 cells, which are arranged in 2x2 blocks with no gaps in the top, bottom, left, or right. The top and bottom interfaces are 0-10 cells long, and the left and right interfaces are 10-20 cells long.\n2.
