          "The rule to find the common rule mapping from input and output is to divide the input grid into subgrids of size 5 by the size of the output grid, but the subgrids in the first input grid are not padded or connected to solve the problem. The second input grid is a single dimension problem, with a few walls to solve, and the output grid is composed of a 4x4 column, but the rules are constant for all input and output.\n\nWoodpecker-J each time to determine the parity of the input, check if it is even or odd. The output grid is a 4x4 column, and the rules are constant for all input and output, so Woodpecker needs to check whether the parity is even or odd. In the second row, there are six 1s in a little over a second. It's a good trace that makes the parity a low value, because the parity should be a high value. So he tweaks the output and sees that it's almost perfect.",
          "Applying the rule:\nAs we know that a number in an 8x8 grid corresponds to a row and column in a 2D array, we can take this as an input grid and assign it to another array, where the size of the array corresponds to the number of rows and columns of the 8x8 grid.\n\nThe input grid is sorted in ascending order, so the correct output is the same as the given example. In this instance, the number needs to be moved from the index [4] to the index [4 + 1] (4 * 5 + 1), and the output is:\n\n```\n2  2  2  4 3  2  0  1\n```",
          "To correctly map a given input grid to an output grid, follow the specified rules:\n\n1. Understand the input and output grids. The input grid is 2-dimensional, representing a 2x2 rectangular grid with integer boundary values. The output grid is also 2x2, which describes two 2-dimensional regions with the same boundary values.\n2. Identify the rules and properties involved. There are two rules to match the input and output grids, which are:\n\t* The input grid contains a positive integer `m` and has a positive integer grid boundary length `b`.\n\t* The output grid contains a positive integer `n` and has a positive integer grid boundary length `a`, where `a = (b + 1) // 2`.\n3. Apply the rules and choose the appropriate solution. The first row can be the output grid, and the second row can be the input grid. The third column can also be the output grid, and the fourth column can be the input grid. The fifth column can be the input grid until the seventh column and then a 0.\n4. Reason about the solution. The input grid can be mapped to two output regions. One region is mapped to the 0",
          "Here's an example of how to find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid:\n\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nOutput: 5 5 0 0\n\nThe input grid is a 0x0 2x2 grid surrounded by 5x5 border grid nodes. A common rule that maps these inputs to the output grid is to add 5 at the top-left corner of the input grid. This is because adding 5 to a 0x0 2x2 grid centered at the top-left corner moves the compass-bearing grid cell to the right.\n\nThe first step in using the common rule is to map the input grid to a 2x2 grid centered at the top-left corner of the input grid. Then, add 5 to the top-left corner of the input grid. Now, the input grid is wrapped around to the right and adds 5 to the top-left corner.\n\nThe next step is to add 5 to the top-right corner of the input grid, which moves the compass-bearing grid cell to the",

For each grid you have observed a corresponding output grid.\n\nBased on the input grids and the testing dataset, there must be a rule that maps the input grid to the output grid. Here's the key: if the grid there has a 1 in the first column and a 2 in the second column, then the output grid must have the combination of 2 and 1 exactly two times. You cannot use any of the other cells (0,0,0,0,0) or any of the internal (0,0,0) cells.\n\nWrite a Python function that takes three arguments: the grid1 and grid2 as input, and returns the output grid as a list.\n\nYour code should pass the following test case:\n```python\ngrid1 = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0],[1,",

This means you can solve the grid by randomly selecting one value to include in each of the six neighboring cells. In this case, the rule indicates that you choose a value of 0. Then, you can use Python to solve the grid and obtain the corresponding output grid.\n\n$\n- Initialize a dictionary to store the keys as `x-coordinate` and `y-coordinate`, and values as `value-coordinate` (i.e., `0`).\n\n$\n- Iterate through 8-10 times for each position of the grid and check for the corresponding direction (`-` or `+`).\n\n$\n- If the direction is `+`, increment the value `value-coordinate` by 1; otherwise, increment the value `value-coordinate` by 2.\n\n$\n- If the value exceeds",
          "Here is my solution to the problem:\n\nIn this very simplistic example we have 3 consecutive (one-step) diagonally adjacent columns that define a simple naming for this model. We can use the `surface_surface_1` grid as a midpoint and the `surface_dashed_mapping` grid as a grid wrapping with the `location` parameter set to `[0, 0]` to define the matching displacement of boundary lights. The `boundary_location` parameter sets the particular location of the boundary lights. We can map the three consecutive rohan squares down through the grid to generate a specific result.\n\nIn this version of the grid model, the grid wraps in the opposite direction and the conditional logic is modified to ensure it maps correctly to the original 8 grid squares. After the `boundary_location` parameter has been set, the grid masking satisfies the edge alignment requirement. This is then used to generate the final shading to match the surface shading."

          "I understand the problem's topic but not the intent of the questions. How about we summarize the steps involved in deductive reasoning:\n\n* Step 1: Define the problem (the preconditions) and formulate a clear statement of the theorem to be proved (the hypothesis): (P \u2192 Q)\n* Step 2: State the relevant implications (conditions) to reach the conclusion: (Q \u2192 Q) IMPLIES Q: (P \u2192 Q) AND Q\n* Step 3: Determine the purpose of the conclusion (the final answer): Determine the state of things in future time: (P denoted by P \u2192 Q)\n\nIn the question, we provide a list of premises. The task is to infer a correct conclusion from the premise.\n\nThe task can be summarized as follows:\n\nStep 1: Define the problem and formulate a clear statement of the theorem to be proved (\u2228)\nStep 2: State the relevant implications (conditions) to reach the conclusion (\u2227)\nStep 3: Determine the purpose of the conclusion (state the state of things in future time: \u2228)\n\nThe evaluation of the answer is as follows:\n\nBased on the relevant conditions of the statement, we",
