Let's consider base 4 for example. In base 4, the digits 0, 1, and 4 are used to represent the base 10 digits 0-9.\n\nTo convert a number from a base to its hexadecimal representation, you need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Convert each non-digit hexadecimal units to digits in base 10.\n2. Convert each hexadecimal units to decimal units in the target base.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\ndef convert_base(base, num):\n    if base > 10:\n        return\n    digits = [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]\n    result = [[9] * 10**(len(digits) - 1 - i) * 10**(9 - i) for i in range(1, len(digits) + 1)]\n    result = [int(digit)",

          "To convert a number from base 11 to hexadecimal, you need to factorize the number and convert the digits to their corresponding base. Let's follow the steps:\n\nStep 1: Factorialize the number\nMultiply the input number by 9 and write the result as a fraction. The numerator represents the sum of the digits in the input number and the denominator represents the number of digits in the result.\n\nStep 2: Convert digits to their corresponding base\nSince the result is a power of 10, each digit in the input number represents the power of 10. To convert each digit into a base, you can use the following steps:\n\n* If the digit is less than 9, convert it to its corresponding lower-case letter (e.g., convert '1' to 'a' for English).\n* If the digit is greater than 9, convert it to its corresponding upper-case letter (e.g., convert '9' to 'b' for Latin).\n\nHere is how you can implement this using Python code:\n```python\ndef factorize(n):\n    factorized_str = \"\"  # Initialize the factorized string\n    factor ",
          "Here is a possible approach:\n\n```python\ndef base_converter(base, decimal_number):\n    a = decimal_number - 11  # Starting point for conversion\n    format = '0+X'  # Format of the original input\n    decimal_number = '0' + str(decimal_number)  # Convert to hexadecimal format\n    decimal_number = hex(int(decimal_number, 16))  # Convert to hexadecimal\n\n    return a + format % format - (len(format) + 1)  # Convert to base-11-encoded format\n```",

The monadic `(` operator checks if the target base is within the specified range. If it is not, a warning is raised. Otherwise, a `>` operator is used to convert the base-11 to base-8 shortly. Finally, the `255` bit of the `number` is flipped into a base-10 binary string of leading zeros to obtain the",

For example, if the target base is 10 and you want to convert the base-11 number 169, the answer would be `XXXX00`\n\n```\ndecimalNumber = 169\ndecimalNumber = '0x1203'\ndecimalNumber = 'a0b1c1'\ndecimalNumber = '8a4c-b57'\n```",
