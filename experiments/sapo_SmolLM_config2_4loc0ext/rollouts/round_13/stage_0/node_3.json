          "The simplest way to answer this question is to extend the last digit from the first number to the first number. To do so, we can use addition to get the first number, then subtract the last digit from the previous number.\n\nFor example, if we are in blank cells 01, 02, 03, and 04, the first step is to add 6 to each cell to get 6, 15, and 22. Then, we subtract these sums of 6, 15, and 22 to get 5, 8, and 11 respectively.

This means that miles will be negative when - 12435 is added to the product of the negative value from the subtraction part (answer - 0) with the remaining kilometers from 1714. The next part of the final answer will indicate the amount to move",
