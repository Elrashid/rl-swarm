          "11e = 1100\nSo, 1100 = 10possue\nSolution\nTo convert a number between two different bases, you can use the arithmetic operations of addition and subtraction, followed by multiplication and division.\n\nWe can write the number 11e as a text representation and then convert it to the target base by using the convention that letters represent decimal digits from 0-9.\n\nThen, we can use the multiplication operation to obtain the base-e number.\n\nAdditionally, we need to convert the target base to decimal and remove the redundant (non-base-2) digits.\n\nLet's first examine the simplest case, where the base is 10, and the mixed number is 11e. As we know, 11(e) = 10 possessue, so it can be factored as 900. Since it has no zeros, it is represented as 900.\n\nNow, if the base is not 10, and the case is left-most digit-of-all-ones (19), we can convert it as 19 to decimal.\n\nSo, 900",

If the base is between 10 and 15, the number can be converted to base 4 using the given method. In this case, the first 2 digits of the number are multiplied by 10 and the last digit is converted to 4. The remainder of the number is then used to convert it to a base 4.",
          "Here's an example solution:\n```\ndef base_convert(number, base):\n    result = ''\n    while number >= 10 ** base:\n        number = number - 10 ** base\n    if number >= 10 ** base:\n        digit = number // 10 ** base % 10\n        result = chr(ord('a') + digit - ord('A') - 1)\n        return result\n    return result\n```",

It starts with a initial value of 0, and then uses a while loop to add the digits of the target base and the base one at a time until the base becomes zero. The digits of the target base and the base one are then raised to their corresponding bases using the `factor` constant. The result is then calculated using the modulo operator and compared with the original base number.",

Here `h` and `m` are the two digits above 9, in b shifts to either the right or left, and `s` is the base-15 constant, resulting in 4 bytes.
