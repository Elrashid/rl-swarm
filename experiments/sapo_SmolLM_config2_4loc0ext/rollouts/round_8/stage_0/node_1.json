          "To calculate the taxicab distance of the nearest 0 for each cell in a given square matrix, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Create a matrix of the same size as the input matrix with zeros.\n2. For each row of the matrix, calculate the distance to the nearest 0 by following these steps:\n    - Iterate through the input matrix and find the closest 0.\n    - If you've already found a 0, calculate the distance to the nearest 0.\n    - Otherwise, subtract the nearest 0 from the current cell.\n    - Append the distance to the outer loop to the row of the matrix.\n3. For each row of the matrix, calculate the principal component of the current cell by setting each element to 1.\n4. Repeat the above steps for the outer loop:\n    - For each row of the matrix in step 2, calculate the principal component of the current cell by setting each row to a 0.\n    - Append the principal component value to the matrix of current cells.\n5. Finally, return the matrix of the principal components of each cell.\n\nHere's how you can implement this program:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef",
