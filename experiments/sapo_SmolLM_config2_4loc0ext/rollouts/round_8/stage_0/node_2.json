          "Explanation: !-\nWe want to solve 97 - -88 * ( -79 * 78 ) . To solve this, we first need to isolate the exponent in each term. This is done by subtracting the `* 79` from both terms, followed by adding the exponent of each term to them.\n\n'97' becomes 97 - 79\nTake the second term, -79. So, '-' is a minus sign in the numerator.\n-79 - (-1 * 78)\nWe subtract the `*79` from both terms, so that 78 becomes 0.\n-79 - 0\n-79\nThe value of the expression is changed. After this, we can simplify by considering all possible instances where the coefficient of the exponential term is expressed as 0, such as 5-2 = 3 and 10-2 = 8. Therefore, the possibility of eliminating the coefficient in the simplified terms is the case where 5-2 = 3. Therefore, we conclude that 97 - -88 * ( -79 * 78 )  \u2265 0.\n\n",
