Therefore, we subtract the larger one from the smaller one, as follows:\n\n(16 - 4) = ?\n\nAs the answer cannot be negative, we have:\n\n16 - 4 = ?\n\n3. The answer is 10, which is obtained by subtracting the smaller one from the larger one:\n\n16 - 4 = 10\n\nTherefore, the sum of -4 - -7 is 40, which is the correct answer.",

          "You can solve this problem by using the reduce function in Python. The reduce function is defined as `(a, b) -> a + b`, but in general, it is often pointed to as `def reduce(a, b, f):`. When there are multiple functions involved in the reduction, we can define a single function that returns the result of reducing all values.\n\n```python\ndef reduce(a, b, f):\n    return f(a, b)\n```\n\nOnce you have defined the reduce function in Python, you can use it to compute the missing result. The function `input_and_return_result` takes a single parameter `input_value` as a string. Inside the function, you will need to continue processing the input value accordingly and return the result.\n\n```python\ndef input_and_return_result(input_value):\n    def reduce_field(value):\n        return f(value, input_value)\n    return reduce_field(input_value)\ninput_and_return_result('input_value')\n```\n\nThe `reduce_field` function reduces the value and returns the result. The `input_and_return_result` function takes an",

In case if the target base is greater than 10, we need to convert it to the base-10 representation.\n\nOne way to do so is by converting each digit to its corresponding simple digit. Take the decimal digit, perform the digit-combination concatenation, and raise each digit to the appropriate power of 10 to get the corresponding base.
