It finds the minimum distance for each cell by using the `distance` method. If a cell is both close to a zero and close to itself, it means that its closest neighbor is in closer proximity to zero.

For each cell, use the nearest 0 by subtracting it from the cell distance and add that to the sum of the cell distance. Finally, return the sum as the taxicab distance.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef nearest_distance(cities):\n    taxicab_distance = 0\n    for i in range(len(cities)):\n        nearest_distance = 0\n        for j, cell_row in enumerate(cities):\n            distance = cell_row[i] - nearest_distance\n            nearest_distance += distance\n        taxicab_distance += distance\n    return taxicab_distance\n```",
          "Here's an example implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_nearest_0s(matrix):\n    nearest_zeros = {}\n    for i in range(len(matrix)):\n        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):\n            if matrix[i][j] == 0:\n                nearest_zeros[row_count(i) * (len(matrix) - 1)] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n            row_count(i)\n    return nearest_zeros\n\ndef row_count(row_count):\n    distance_to_nearest_zero = {}\n    for cell in nearest_zeros:\n        distance_to_nearest_zero[cell] = abs(nearest_zeros[cell][1] - row_count[cell])\n    return distance_to_nearest_zero\n\ndef find_nearest_zeros(matrix):\n    nearest_zeros = {}\n    distance_to_nearest_zero = {}\n    for i in range(len(matrix)):\n        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):\n            nearest_zeros[row_count(i) * (len(matrix",

          "To find the nearest 0 for each cell in a matrix, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by converting the matrix to a list of tuples by iterating through each row and column.\n2. For each cell in the matrix, you can calculate the distance to the nearest 0 by using the Pythagorean theorem. This can be achieved by taking the square difference between the cell coordinates and the cell coordinates of the nearest 0 TD.\n3. For each cell in the list, you can add its distance to a running total on each line, from the first point to the last point.\n4. After iterating through all cells in the matrix, you'll have a table that represents the distances from each cell to the nearest 0. The last row of this table will have the total distances.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef plan_dist(matrix: List[List[float]]) -> List[float]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the Manhattan distance of the nearest 0 for each cell in a matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    distances = []\n    visited = set()\n    for x in matrix:\n        for y in x:\n            if (x[",
          "To find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in a 2D matrix, we can leverage the concept of the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences between the x and y coordinates of two points in an n-dimensional grid. In this case, we can map the origin (i.e., the top-left cell) of the matrix to be the average of the two closest points in the matrix.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the function to find the distance to the nearest 0:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef distance_to_nearest_0(matrix):\n    distances = np.zeros(matrix.shape[0])\n    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):\n            distances[i] = abs(j - matrix.shape[0] / 2) + abs(matrix.shape[1] - matrix.shape[0] / 2, matrix.shape[0] / 2 + j)\n    return distances.argmin(axis=0)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we iterate over each cell in the matrix and find the coordinates of the two closest points"
