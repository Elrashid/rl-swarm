          "Simplifying a fraction gives us the simplest form of the fraction, raising it to the power of 0, 1, or n-1.\n\nIn this specific fraction, we want to simplify it as far as possible, meaning that a fraction with a denominator of 1188 is already simplified.\n\nTo reach the simplified fraction, we can divide 252 by 1188 and subtract the remainder.\n\n#### Using Division to Reduce a Fraction\n\nWrite a counterexample with different denominators and examples of how it is simplified.\n\nThe number of bottles in the candy jar is 290. This is multiple of 8. The number of candy bars in the jar is 1188. This is multiples of 8.\n\nFirst, we can write the numerator and denominator as 1188 and 252, respectively. We can also write 1188 and 252 as 1180 and 2520, respectively, as 290 is also divisible by 8.\n\n1180 divided by 252 = 6.53\n1180 divided by",

          "Here are the steps to simplify the fraction 252/1188 to its lowest terms:\n\n1. **Identify the numerator and denominator**: Write the numerator and denominator of the fraction in the same order, with the highest power of the denominator on the top and the lowest power in the denominator on the bottom.\n\nin this case, numerator is 252 and denominator is 1188.\n\n2. **Multiplied numerator and denominator**: Multiply the numerator and the denominator by powers of the smallest term in the denominator to reduce the fraction.\n\n**Example**: Suppose we want to simplify the fraction of 252/1188 to its lowest terms, we multiply numerator and denominator by powers of 2:\n\n252 = 252, so the numerator is now 252\n\n1188 = 1188, so the numerator is now 1188\n\n3. **Common denominators**: Find the common denominator and then use the formula:\n\n**Equation**: Fraction: numerator/denominator\n\nIn this case, numerator divided by denominator is 252.\n\n4. **Simplify the fraction**:",
          "Two common approaches to simplifying fractions include:\n1. **Simplifying Fractions with Common Factors**: Divide the numerator and denominator by common factors to cancel out the factors while remaining in the fraction.\n2. **Simplifying Fractions with Multiplication**: Multiply the numerator and denominator by the smallest common factor to cancel out the factor.\n\nFor example:\n1. 252/1188 is our original fraction, 252 / 1188 = 1/388\n2. Simplifying it to its lowest terms: First find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1188 and 15. The GCF is 284, so we multiply numerator and denominator by 284 to cancel out the 284.\nWe get:\n1/388, which is the simplified fraction.\n\nSimilarly, 204/384 is also simplified, and we can simplify it similarly.\n\n**Example**\nSimplify 5/12 (Simplify to lowest terms)\n20/12\n\nFor the second approach:\n1. First we find the GCF of ",
          "The given fraction is 252/1188, and we want to simplify it to its lowest terms. One way to do this is to subtract 100 from both the numerator and the denominator to get the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 252 and 1188. Then, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the LCM to get the simplified fraction.\n\nWe'll also choose 98 to be part of the simplified fraction. Therefore, 98 becomes 98/100 and the denominator becomes 98^2. Modulo 252, 1/98 = 1/224 and 1/98^2 = 1/1496\n\nOutcome\n simplify fraction 252/1188 => 252/224\n\n#### 1 answer\n######",

Simplify the denominator: 1188 reduces to 3/1 since 13/3 = 4/1.\n\n3. Simplify the remaining fraction: To simplify the numerator, we combine the common factors between 5 and 18 by recycling: 5, 18, 4, 13, 1, 5, 4, 6, and 1.\n\n5/4 = 2/2, 13/1 = 13/4, 1/1\n\n4/1 = 4/1, 1\n\n3/1 = 3/1, 13/1 = 13/4,",

For example, we want to translate \"BOOLEAN - A < B>\" into \"Python: (1) < 2>= Python: (1-100) -> (fix 100)\".\n\nTo achieve this translation, we can define a Python tuple that represents the disambiguation relation between the BF entities. The key for every BF entity is a dictionary that maps the BF entity name to a tuple representing its disambiguation relation. We can then build the PyTorch BF entity graph by traversing the Python tuples and their corresponding disambiguation relations.
