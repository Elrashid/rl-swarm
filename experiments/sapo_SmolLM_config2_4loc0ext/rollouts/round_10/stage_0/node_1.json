          "Computing the taxi cab distance is a common evaluation metric in computer vision and natural language processing tasks, where it is often used to measure the minimum distance between two inputs.\n\nTo find the taxicab distance of a cell, we can iterate through the rows of the matrix and update the distance between each cell and its neighbor cells for the corresponding cell of the input matrix. This is known as the \"manhattan distance\" or \"geometric distance\".\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this idea:\n\n```python\ndef taxi_cab_distance(mat, cell):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the taxi cab distance of a cell from its neighbor's cell in the given matrix.\n    Args:\n        mat (numpy.ndarray): A 2D matrix of shape (height, width) representing the input matrix\n        cell (int): The cell to compute the distance to\n    Returns:\n        numpy.ndarray: A 2D array of shape (width, height) containing the distance from the cell to its neighbor's cell\n    \"\"\"\n    distance = 0\n    for row in range(cell.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(cell.shape[1]):\n            if (cell[row][col] != cell_dist",
          "The task specifies that each input matrix is a grid of rows and columns, and each cell is assumed to be a 0 representing a cell that is not visited yet. Our goal is to find the minimum distance to the nearest 0 using the Manhattan metric. The output for each cell should be the distance to the nearest 0.\n\nAdditionally, the constraints for this problem are that each input matrix for a given cell has the same size as the input matrix for that cell. Finally, the input matrix may contain outliers, which are non-zero elements within a certain range (e.g., 0-10). Please indicate the number of the outliers, if any, for each input matrix.\n\nHere is the implementation of the algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef nearest_0(matrix):\n    num_rows, num_cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    nearest_distances = [float('inf')] * num_rows\n    for r in range(num_rows):\n        for c in range(num_cols):\n            if matrix[r][c] != 0:\n                distances = [0, 0, 0]\n                for r_plus, c_plus in [[r",
          "To find the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in the given square matrix, you can follow the steps described below:\n\n1. Read the input matrix using the `get_matrix` function.\n2. Initialize an empty array `distance_to_nearest_0` of the same size as the input matrix and set its first element to 0.\n3. Iterate through each cell in the input matrix.\n4. If the cell is 1, compare it to the nearest 0 cell using the `is_better` function, which returns a Boolean value indicating whether a cell is better than another cell. The function accepts two integers as inputs and returns a boolean value. If the cell is 1 then set the corresponding cell value of the `distance_to_nearest_0` array to the value of the nearest 0 cell.\n5. Repeat step 4 for all cells in the input matrix.\n6. After all the cells are processed, the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell is stored in the `distance_to_nearest_0` array.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `get_matrix` function and the `is_better` function:\n\n```python\ndef",
          "To calculate the Manhattan distance of the nearest 0 for each cell, you can use Python's built-in `min()` function to find the smallest distance between the nearest 0 in the example matrix and the point represented by the cell's row and column assignment.\n\nHere's how you could implement a Python function to find the Manhattan distance of the nearest 0 for each cell:\n\n```python\ndef n0_distance(matrix):\n    n0_dict = {}\n    n0_dict[0] = 1\n    n0_dict[1] = 1\n    for row in a:\n        for col in row:\n            if col >= 0 and col < len(matrix[0]):\n                d = abs(row - (col + 0)) + abs(col - (row + col_1))\n                n0_dict[c] = min(n0_dict[c], d)\n    return [f\"The movement of a 0 to {v} is ${n0_dict[v]} kilometer\".format(v=v) for v in n0_dict]\n```",

The function should return a matrix where each entry in the first row is the distance to the nearest 0 and each entry in the last row is the mean of the distances to all cells.\n\nHere is an example implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef square_matrix_distance(matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate distances from the cell containing a given number and return a matrix\n    where each entry in the first row is the distance to the nearest 0 and each\n    entry in the last row is the mean of the distances to all cells.

Two values are calculated: the grid (neighbourhood) and the index of the nearest 0 (reference point). The nearest 0 distance is calculated for each cell and stored in the `nearest_0_distances` list. The matching indices for each nearest 0 distance are then added to the `distances` dictionary.",
