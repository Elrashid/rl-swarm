          "Simplifying the fraction means reducing it to its simplest form, making it easier to read and work with. To do that, we need to cancel out the common factors of numerator and denominator. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\nFirst, let's simplify both numerator and denominator by eliminating any common factors completely from the top and bottom of the fraction.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n numerator: 28/294\ndenominator: 294 \u00d7 4 = 1112 + 4 (it's impossible to cancel out all the fractions in the denominator)\n\nTo multiply two fractions, multiply their numerator and subtract the product of the numerator and denominator. In our case, multiplying 4 by 2:\n\n numerator: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\ndenominator: 1112 + 4 = 125\nsimplified fraction: 48/125\n\nTo cancel out the common factors, we'll divide both the numerator and denominator by their LCM (Least Common Multiple). In our case:\n\nLCM = 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 (it's impossible to divide an integer by any",
          "To simplify the fraction 28/294 to its lowest terms, we need to convert the numerator and denominator to lowest terms.\n\nThe numerator is the top number in the fraction and represents the number of equal parts out of 294. This is 6 tens and 8 zeros.\n\nThe denominator is the bottom number in the fraction and represents the total number of equal parts out of 294. This is 2 ten-thousands comma flies for four tokens.\n\nSimplification of dividing 6 tens and 8zeros by 294 is achieved by dividing 6 tens and 8zeros by 294, the total number of equal parts in 294.\n\nThis method of division yields a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1.\n\nIt is evident that the final fraction is 2 without any additional terms, e.g., `28`/`294`.\n\nHere is the simplified fraction: `28/294`\n\nThe video solution explains how to simplify the fraction using the long division method:\n\nThe long division method is a method of divisibility testing to determine whether a dividend is divisible"
