Then, it iterates over each digit in the number and converts it to a capital letter using `str()`. Finally, it appends the converted digits to a list and converts it back to a base-10 integer using `int()`.",
          "There are two ways to convert the number 1422 to base-15: Using the formula below to solve the problem for the numerical value.\n\nBase-10: 1422 \u21d2 a + b x 10 + c\n\nBase-6: 1422 \u21d2 a + b \u2297 10 + c\n\nRelative to the given conditions., the number 1422 should be converted to a value of 10 units on the die, where a is the sum of digits 1, 4, and 2 and b is the product of 1 and 5.\n\nThe solution can be achieved by representing the top two digits in the decimal representation of withe the mental operations of the numbers.\n\nFor the given integer value, we can write the top two digits as \"the\", \"b\" and the repectively lowest number with '1' as \"1422\" is \"1422\". The middle digits should be doubles the number of \"a\".\n\nThe solution may depend on the characteristics of different bases, the SI system of measurement, including a trivial and very convenient approximation also possible.",

If the target base is a multiple of 6, we convert the base-6 number to the base-6, and then convert the numbers that are multiples of 6 to the base-6. If the target base is not a multiple of 6, we convert the base-6 number to the base-6 and then multiply it by 6. Then, we convert the numbers that are multiples of 6 to the base-6. Finally, we return the numbers converted to the appropriate base.",
          "A classic problem!\n\nConvert an integer to a number between two bases, say 2 and 5, by using `down` and `up` shifts in both bases. The down shift means moving down the number by the smallest common divisor of the bases (below 1), while the up shift means moving up by the largest common divisor of the bases (above 1). Then, multiply the resulting number by 2^(base-15) to get the decimal representation, and then add 9 to the result. This should result in the original number.\n\nHere's how you would approach this problem:\n\n1. Check the number representation in both bases:\n\n`base-15` is represented in 15 different digits, which represent digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, with a shift of 5 in each digit. `base-2` is represented in 2 digits (0-1), so you can simply lift each digit by 5 (-10 to -5, 5 to 0) and start with 2.\n\nThe base 15 conversion involves moving down by 5 digits to get the new value, which is -10 +",

          "The base-6 number 1422 can be converted to base-15, but it will start with an 'a'. To get to the correct base, we can divide the number by 6, but we will start with 'a'. Then, we can take the remainder of the number divided by 6 and add 'a'. This process will eventually lead us to the correct base:\n\nUsing the provided input, we can extract the base-6 number from the original number. The target base is 12. We take the first 7 bits of the number represented as 'a'. This will lead us to the target base 15.\nThe original number can be converted to base 15 by dividing each digits in the range [0, 9] by 15 until reaching zero. When dividing, we take the last 10 digits. This might not always approach zero.\n\nWe can implement this conversion in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef base6_to_base15(base_6_number: int) -> int:\n    base_6 = base_6_number // 6\n    remainder = base_6_number % 6\n    `*`;"

This method leverages the following condition:\n\n```",
          "Here's how you can write a Python function that calculates the taxicab distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in the given square matrix:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_taxicab_distance(matrix):\n    distances = {}\n\n    for row in range(len(matrix)):\n        for column in range(len(matrix[0])):\n            distance = math.sqrt(\n                (\n                    matrix[row][column]\n                    - 0\n                    * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi * ((-1) ** column)**2)\n                    + 0\n                    * (1 / (math.pi * ((-2) ** 2)) * math.exp(-0.5 * ((row + column) ** 2)) * math.log3())\n                    + 0\n                    * (0.5 * ((-2) ** 2) - 0) // (math.log10(2))  # 2^2 column hi\n                    + math.floor(0.3 * ((-2) ** 2) - 0)  # 2^3 row lo\n                ) + 0\n            )\n\n            distances[row, column] = distance\n\n    for key, row in distances.items",
          "Let's assume that the problem is defined as:\n\n```\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> def compute_nearest_0(matrix):\n...     row_distances = np.sum((matrix[:, :-1] * matrix[:,1:]), axis=1)\n...     delta = np.max(row_distances)\n...     return Matrix([[delta if c != 0 else (c, delta) for c in range(matrix.shape[1])]])\n```\n\nThe first step is to compute the distance between each cell (0, 0 in this case) and the nearest 0. The distance can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:\n\n`distance = ((x * x) + (y * y) + (c * c)) ** 2`\n\nwhere `x`, `y`, and `c` are respectively the x- and y-coordinate of the row and column.\n\nOnce we have the distances, we can add the nearest 0 within the cell. This means replacing the cell row with the nearest 0. We can do this by finding the nearest 0 in the computed nearest_0 matrix and using this as a reference coordinate in the cell row.\n\n",
          "Here's an example implementation of the required function:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef closest_zero(matrix):\n    tortoise = 0\n    hare = 0\n    distance = 0\n\n    while len(matrix) > 0:\n        pos = (hare + tortoise) % len(matrix)\n        if 0 < pos < len(matrix):\n            distance += matrix[pos]\n\n        if distance > 0:\n            tortoise = pos\n            distance = 0\n\n        if 0 <= pos < len(matrix):\n            distance += matrix[pos]\n\n        apache = 0\n        while distance > 0:\n            heapq.heappush(matrix, (maximum_distance, apache))\n            distance = heapq.heappop(matrix)\n            apache += 1\n\n        tortoise = apache\n\n    return deque(matrix)\n```\n\n- The `distance` constant stores the distance from the current cell to the 0 cell. It's initialized to 0.\n- The `tortoises` and `hairs` variables initialize the distance from each cells to the 0 cell.\n- The `while` loop iterates until the length of the matrix is 0.",

The function iterates through each cell in the input matrix, finds the distance to the nearest 0, and adds it to the `distance_to_nearest_0` dictionary."
