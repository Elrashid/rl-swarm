I'll provide the detailed explanation below, where the final value would be rounded up to 5 significant digits.\n\nStep-by-Step Process:\n\n1. Calculate the error: The given solution -2.03 is approximately 0.02 which is an extremely small error. It means that the output value reduces further until the calculation is completed. The result is 0.0203.\n2. Get the adjusted decimal: The output value is 0.004444 and this is obtained by dividing -2.03 by 0.0044444 (a very small value). The calculated value decreases by such an amount that it is similar to the original value.\n3. Check if the decimal is considered significant: To ensure that the decimal is included in the calculation, this result can be compared with the original value.

The base of a number can be a decimal number (base 10), a hexadecimal number (base 16), or a floating-point number (base 12).\n\nIn base 6, you have the option to reverse the digits of the number. In base 8, there are eight digits. So, it will be a more straightforward conversion, as the reverse digits are done.\n\nHere are step-by-step instructions on how to convert between the two bases:\n1. Write down the decimal or hexadecimal number you want to convert to base 6. For example, let's convert 1413 to base 8.\n2. Write down the base 6 number in reversed form (hundreds, tens, ones).

We can do this by repeatedly shifting the leading pair right until it reaches the digit 9.\n\n```\n9 \u00b7 4 = 37\n```\n\nNow, we have the basic answer: 37/4 is the decimal equivalent of the base-6 number.\n\nTo convert it to base-8,",

You can write the string 5 to the left of the base-8 string 5, as 5 is the 21st digit of the base-9 string. This base-9 string could be written as 500.\nStep 3: Convert the base-9 string to the base-3 alphabet by dropping the 5 and adding the remaining 20 as rest.
