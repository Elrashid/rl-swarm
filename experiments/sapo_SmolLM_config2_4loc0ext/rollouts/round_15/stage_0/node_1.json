Division: Subtract the numerator from the denominator: $6475600 - \\frac{2150 }{3096} = 2150$\n3. Simplification: Simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3096: $\\frac{2150}{3096} = \\frac{2150 \\div 3096 }{3096 \\div 3096} = \\frac{2150 \\div 166 }{96^2} = \\frac{156.67}{96^{2+2}} \\approx 1.71$\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction $\\frac{2150}{3096}$ is approximately $\\frac{1.71}{106.67}$.",

          "To simplify a fraction, you can use the following method: multiply 2150 by 3 to get 66000, add 300 to 66000 to get 66350, and now subtract 66350 from both 66350 and 300 to get a new fraction 43950.\n\nTherefore, the simplest form of $\\frac{2150}{3096}$ is 43950/3096.\n\nThe easiest approach is to start by multiplying both 2150 and 300, ending up with 3300. Then, subtract 3300 from 43950. However, this approach is not always the most concise. Here's the way the modulo operation can be used to simplify a fraction:\n\nThe 3300 algorithm is called \"combinatorial\" because it counts the number of elements in an array and each step of the algorithm counts up or down by a fixed step. In the rooted tree problem, 3300 arranges the nodes into a tree. The logic is",
          "Simplifying $\\frac{2150}{3096}$ to its lowest terms requires rewriting it in its simplest form. To achieve this, we can divide both numerator and denominator by 3. The numerator represents the number of separate parts or items, while the denominator represents the total quantity of items.\n\nThe numerator can be simplified to read \"2150 parts\" (represented by the vinculum), while the denominator, represented by 3096, can be simplified first to read \"3096 parts\" (represented by the vinculum).
