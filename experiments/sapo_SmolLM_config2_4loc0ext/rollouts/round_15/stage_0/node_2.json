The reduction process involves dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 27 in this case. The GCD of 27 and 1558 is 12; hence, we can divide both numerator and denominator by 12.\n\n#### Step-by-step explanation\n\n1. Multiply both numerator and denominator by 3/2 to simplify the fraction: $\\frac{1066}{1558} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{336}{27}$\n2. Divide both numerator and denominator by 27 to obtain the simplified fraction: $\\frac{\\frac{336}{27}}{\\frac{27}{27}} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{12}{12}} = \\frac{\\overline{336}}{2\\overline{12}} = \\frac{69}{32}$\n\n#### Simplified fraction: $\\frac{6",
          "To simplify a fraction, the key is to find a common factor of the numerator and denominator that is not one. In this case, the numerator is 1066. Next, you can divide 1066 by 558. The answer you get is $\\frac{1066 \\div 558}{558 \\div 558}=\\frac{44}{34}=2\\frac{1}{4}$. However, we have to be careful with this answer. We have excluded the factor 1 in the numerator and denominator of the fraction. To evaluate the fraction we have chosen, we can plug in the value of $2\\frac{1}{4}$ into the equation and simplify the result. We get: $2\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{2}{3}$. A simplified fraction is one where the numerator and denominator have no common factor dividing the numerator and denominator or having any common factors with the denominator.\n\nOutcome:\nThe answer to this question is $\\frac{1066\\div 1558}{1558\\div 1558}=\\frac{2\\frac{1}{4",
          "Here are steps to help you solve this problem:\n\nWe can first rewrite $\\frac{1066}{1558}$ as a fraction:\n\nSince $1558$ can be expressed as $155 \\div 2$, we can divide numerator and denominator by $2$. This can be achieved by using the powers of $2$:\n$$\\frac{1066}{155 \\div 2}=\\frac{66}{78}=\\frac{2}{7}=\\frac{2}{7}=2$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite it as a mixed fraction:\n\nBy dividing the numerator by the denominator (the expression above), we can rewrite $3\\frac{3}{2}$ as $3\\frac{3}{2}=\\frac{9}{2}=\\frac{17}{2}=\\frac{31}{2}-1=31$.\n\nSince we are given $155 \\div 2$, we can rewrite the fraction again, only this time in its lowest terms:\n\nSince $155 \\div 2$ cannot be expressed as a fraction, we need to allow the possibility of having",

          "To simplify the fraction $\\frac{1066}{1558}$, we need to divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 1066 and 1558 is 6. Follow these steps to simplify the fraction:\n\n1. Divide both the numerator and denominator by their GCD to get x and y, respectively: x = 6//gcd(1066, 1558) and y = 6//gcd(1066, 1558)\n2. Simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCD: $\\frac{(x)(6)}{(y)(15)} = \\frac{3.6}{4.33} = \\frac12$\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is $\\frac{3.6}{4.33}$.\n\nYour code should pass the following test case:\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\nassert simplify_fraction(1066.7 // 1558.2) == Fraction(1.25)\nassert simplify_fraction(155",

This leaves you with $1066-1558$, which is $13$.\n\nSimplifying a fraction can be done in several ways. One way is to divide both the numerator and denominator of the fraction by their greatest common divisor (GCD) in the denominator.

          "Step-by-Step Solution:\n\nFirst, we need to simplify the fraction $\\frac{1066}{1558}$. To do so, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). We know that 1558 has a GCD of 19. Therefore, we can use the GCD algorithm to simplify the fraction:\n1. Since the GCD of 1558 and 19 is 19, we can divide both numerator and denominator by the GCD.\n2. So, $\\frac{1066}{19}\\times\\frac{3}{3}\\times \\frac{1}{1}=\\frac{3\\times 19\\times 1}{19\\times 3}\\times\\frac{3}{3}\\times \\frac{1}{1}\\neq\\frac{3\\times 19\\times 1}{19\\times 3}\\times\\frac{3}{3}\\times \\frac{1}{1}$.\n3.
