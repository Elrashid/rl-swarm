          "The task is to convert a number between two different bases such as 10, 16, and 20.\nTo do this, let's discuss how to convert between 10, 16, and 20 bases. To convert to base 10, we can use the standard digit-position table. For example, when we convert 41a to base 6, we move one step to the left, one step to the right, and two steps down.\n\nWhen converting to 16, we can use the standard 1-9 digit-position table: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nWhen converting to 20, we can use the standard 10-digit-position table: 0010, 5001, 1001, 1101\u00e8re, 11051, 13051, 15015, 16131, 21014, 23014, 25113, 26",

For tens, the representation is as follows:\n\na 9 = 9 1\na 8 = 2 1\na 7 = 3 1\na 6 = 4 1\na 5 = 5 1",

Otherwise, we simply subtract the current value from the target value to represent the smaller base.\n\nNext, we determine the number of bits in the target integer.\n\nIf the target base is 16, we prepend 16 to the target value and return the sum.\n\nIf the target base is 6, we put the value at 16",
