          "The input grid's shape can be quite wide and will be encoded using the concept of AND and OR operations. The output grid will have the desired shape, except for the number of rows and columns at the end.\n\nTo implement the support for different shape extraction using the rules outlined, we need a recursive function that takes in a grid and returns the corresponding output grid. The base case is when the grid cannot be split: a non-consecutive pair of cells are connected. In this case, the output grid fits the grid with the aligned cells. If the grid cannot be split correctly, the result can be a rectangular shape as we assume the shapes are always rectangular. The function can be expressed in a recursive manner, taking the grid as an argument and calling itself to process the surrounding cells. This ensures that the output grid fits correctly and the current output grid can be resolved with the surrounding cells. We can also assume that the output grid is aligned with the rows and columns at the end.",
          "Common rule: Grid with constant values\nTo complete this task, we'll apply the rule of placing the \"pockets\" in a way such that they are \"connected\" to each other, allowing us to connect them further. In this case, the connection between different \"pockets\" needed to be maintained. Given the three examples in the question, we'll try to create three different circular loops of \"pockets\" in the same region. This way, the connecting two \"pockets\" will appear on the grid. This will, in turn, allow us to connect three more \"pockets\" through the last one, and so on.\n\nTo apply the same rule to the three examples, we'll check if:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}\n\\begin{array}{|c|ccc|}\n\\hline \\/ \\_____ & \\/\\ | \\/\\ | \\/\\ | \\/\\ | \\/\\ | \\/\\ | \\/\\ | \\/\\ | 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\\\\\\\\n\\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\",

          "Here's how you can solve this:\n\nFirst, you need to define a function to convert a number between the given bases.\nHere's how you could do it:\n```python\ndef convert_base(base, n_base):\n    pass\n\ndef convert_base_5(n_base5, base):\n    return sum(n_base5)**base\nbase = 5\nprint(convert_base(base, 5))\n```\n\nIn the `convert_base` function, we define a function of the given encoding and define the conversion formula.\n\nThe `convert_base_5` function accepts two parameters: `base` and `n_base5`. It returns the square root of the product of the exponent `n_base5` and the base `base` using the `pow` function.\n\nYou can write the following test function to validate the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef test_base_conversion():\n    assert convert_base(base, 5) == 166211703492064071332794907569350081882",
          "To convert a number between two bases, you need to apply the conversion rules for each base separately. Here are the rules for converting hexadecimal (base-16) to decimal, ternary (base-3), and base-5.\n\n**Hexadecimal (base-16) to Decimal**\n\n* Base-16 (e.g., \"1a\u00e9fg\" or \"A9C7\") can only have four digits (0-9, a-f).\n* Four digits can be represented by four digits at a time, starting from the right.\n* Each digit can be expressed as a concatenation of numbers 0 to 9, using the following rules:\n\t+ 0 is interpreted as a zero\n\t+ 1 is interpreted as the literal symbol \"1\" (e.g., +1 in decimal notation)\n\t+ 2, 3 and 4 are interpreted as the literal digits \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\", respectively, placing them in a specific order (zero = D, 1 = E, 2 = F, and 3 = G, 4 = A)\n* The final digit in the result",
          "To solve this problem, we would need a different implementation for both the base-5 and base-6 cases. In the first case, we would first convert the number to a list of characters using the `ord()` function, with the first 3 characters as a prefix. Finally, we would convert the list of characters to their decimal representation by multiplying each character with 10. Then, we would add the last digit to the appropriate part of the result to reach the final base-6 number. In the second case, the number would be converted to a list of digits using the `int()` function, with the first 5 digits as a prefix. We would then take the integer part of each digit and multiply it with `10` to reach the base-6 number. Then, we would add the digits in the list to the appropriate parts of the result to reach the final base-6 number.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that implements the above instructions:\n\n```python\ndef base23_numbers(number):\n    base23_list = []\n    digit_list = []\n    remainder = 0\n    while number:\n        digit_list.append(number % 10)\n        remainder += number // ",

Make a base-6 table (a table for storing all possible numbers) with 1 set of digits for each position\n3. Choose a position and assign each digit of 3234 (3, 2, 3, and 4) in the base-6 table\n4. Fill in the digits in the table according to the following rules:\n\t* If the digit is 3, add 1 to the previous digit (e.g., 3 -> 5)\n\t* If the digit is 2, add 2 to the next digit (e.g., 2 -> 4)\n\t* If the digit is 3, add 3 to the previous digit (e.g., 3 -> 1)\n\t* If the digit is 4, take the previous digit (e.g., 4 -> 0)\n5.

          "Using CHOPS-II, the system can be programmed to perform such operations. The target base is 5, inclusive, and the system will use lowercase letters a-z to represent digits above 9. For example, when the target base is 5, the system would use letters b' for 100, and numbers-1's would be used for 110.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of this approach using CHOPS-II:\n\n```python\n// Construct the CHOPS-II REPL code\ngeneratorHere(\"HHABB\", \"00000011001000100\" + 100 * 10)\ngeneratorAfterExpected(`m\u00e5k \u03ba\u03b1 ally assince soucup oyn\u02c8\u03a3u\u201c\u00f3\u00a0 amongst\u0254\u0294 a\u02ce\u02c8\u0141\u03b1\u03bdJO interest mo\u0114\u02c0\u05ea\u00ac\u02c1 O\u02dc\u2200 2 2 0 awaits \u03b1'' \u03ba\u03ac engeniage A\u02dcU`\u25b8Gr\u00e5a\u031e\u1e0b\u02c0 4.6S|L \u0251\u02dco\u221b\u00b8a?| a}{",
          "To convert a number to its equivalent in a different base, you can use the rules of place value and the conversion chart. The digits can be thought of as 0-9, which you can represent as digits in a base-0 system. The digits in the given number 3234 will take on these symbols and represent 3 (base-0) + 2 (base-4) + 3 (base-5).\n\nUsing the place-value system, we can see that the digits 323, 432, 343, 434, and 344 will have their values based on their position in the number. The 3 and 4 represent the tens place, the 3 and 4 represent the ones place, and so on.\n\nSo in the given number 3234, the digits 3, 2, 2, and 3 will have their respective values:\n\n3 (tens-place): 6\n2 (hundreds-place): 0\n2 ( tenths-place): 1\n3 (units-place): 3\n\nSince the place-value system is 10 digits long, the",
