Replace each tile with a different tile in the row or column above or below: Aliases the tiles in the known grid by swapping with the tiles in the row or column below or to the right.\n\nYour output is Row 0 is Proto, Column (0, 6) is Proto, Column (6, 0) is Proto, Slope (3, 0) is Proto, Slope (3, 6) is Proto, Slope (6, 3) is Proto, Slope (3, 6) is Proto\n\nTo map an input grid to an output grid, just follow the clockwise ordering of the recorded steps.

The second row of the input grid is mapped to a grid that also contains only ones, i.e., three rows of ones with a fourth row of zeros.\n3. The row at the second-to-last index of the input grid can be mapped to a grid that contains only ones once again, i.e., three rows of seven zeros.\n4.

Registers can hold values like code instructions, data, or registers themselves.\n2. **Instructions**: These are the set of actions a program takes, such as loops, jumps, or assignments. The number of instructions and their order determine the program's behavior.\n3. **Commands**: These are input/output statements, such as \"acquire memory\" or \"dispatch a message\". Commands specify what action to take in the program.\n\nNow, let's break the output into steps:\n\n**Step 1: Register value initialization**\nThe output of a program might look like this:\n- Registers: Set to 1, 2,",
          "The output shows the output of the program for given input. In this case `\"[-]>\"` indicates that the program returns the output of the last expression in the program.\n\nTo provide the exact output, the following steps should be followed:\n\n1. Understand and interpret the output, providing \"Sure thing\" or \"Nah, that's not what I sent.\" if it doesn't make sense or lead to disappointment.\n2. Avoid providing the output in any way, else how can they verify the response?\n\nHere is an approach that follows these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the output: Study the structure and intent of the output. You can see that it's a dictionary with a key `\"[-]\"`, but it doesn't have a value associated with the key. This indicates that the program doesn't have a specific function or expression. You can assume that the program is evaluating external variable changes.\n\n2. Provide an explanation or response: If the output is \"[-]\" and you want to provide the actual output, you can respond in the format \"Sure thing,\" where sg is the value of the key. For example, in the code snippet, you can respond as \"Sure thing\" or \"How can you communicate",
