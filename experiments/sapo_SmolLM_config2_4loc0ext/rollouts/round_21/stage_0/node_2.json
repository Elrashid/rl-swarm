Here are the steps:\n\nDateTime(year, month, day of month) - Year - (Holiday Null Date) - Month - Day of Day Reference Date\n\nSince the ISOG resembled a two-day event, I would calculate the Day of the Month (First Day) as 1, as do so for March 3 and April 1. I would also treat February as February 3rd, March 2nd, and so on. Divide each day's UTC start time by 7 to get the inclusive start time of each event.
