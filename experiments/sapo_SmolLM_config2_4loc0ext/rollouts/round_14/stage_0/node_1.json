          "In the next Fiscal 11-13 calendar period, it's likely that there will be some weekends, with a possible Tuesdays. However, the number of Thursdays will not be a fixed constant, but will vary according to the timestamps and dates. To calculate the number of Thursdays, you can use the following steps:\n\n- Identify the day ranges based on the timestamps in the previous four fiscal years and their corresponding calendar years.\n- Determine the days during which Thursdays would be held on the previous three fiscal years.\n\nHere's a rough sample outline:\n\n* Fiscal 1/2 0-1 February\n* Fiscal 2/3 2-3 February\n* Fiscal 3/4 4-5 February\n* Fiscal 4/5 6-7 February\n\nFor each Fiscal 1/2 day, the points are those points where the following calendar year'spartum (also known as the fiscal fiat) starts. For example, for the 2nd fiscal year, a calendar year'spartum would be January 2, February 1, March 4, and April 3. Each of these points will allow for a Tuesdays, corresponding to"
