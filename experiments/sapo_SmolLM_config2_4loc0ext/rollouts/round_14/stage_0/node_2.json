To calculate the year difference, subtract the year from this date and divide by 4.\n\n2. Look for leap year signs. In the Last Year of the Gregorian Year, there are two leap year signs: `4` and `8`. The first one is a leap year because January 1st is a leap day (e.g., February 29th in the current calendar). The second one is also a leap day, which is followed by the next day in the year. In the Last Year of the Gregorian Year, there is no such leap year sign because the year is 400 years since the completion of the calendar.\n\n3. Check if the 4th or 8th day falls on a Sunday.

Therefore, if the year is divisible by 400, it should be considered a leap year by default, except for an only 400 years loop.\n\nLet's find the first 400 years of 2073, and then check if it is divisible by 100, 400, 100, 2000.\n\n* First 400 years: 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, ",

Adding -55 to 2, we get -12",
          "Calculus is a mathematical method that deals with rates of change and accumulation of quantities over time or space. It helps us understand how things change over time and space. In the context of gre biology, calculus is used to analyze the changes in body mass of animals and humans over time.\n\nHere's how to compute the answer:\n\n1. Calculate the rate of change of body mass by:\n```\na: read body mass in units of kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2)\nb: read body mass in units of kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) from the given dataset\nresult: formula of the body mass change => 1: (\u222ba x b) / a = body mass change => _\u2211 c x b \\* d^2 x a^2 + _\u2211 d x a^2 = result\n```\nwhere `c` and `d` are constants that balance the derivative equations.\n\n2. Apply differentiation to calculate the second derivative, which is `dx/dx`:\n```\ndx/dx = 1 / (1 + c^2)^2\nresult:  c's form for the second derivative => c^2 = -5.25\n```",
          "To compute the sum of the list of integers `[3, -4, -5, 6, -7, 8]`, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute each element of the list:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_integers(nums):\n    return sum(num for num in nums if num < 0)\n\nnums = [3, -4, -5, 6, -7, 8]\nsum_of_integers(nums)\n```\n\nThe `sum_of_integers` function takes a list of integers as input and returns their sum without explicitly defining each element. Instead, it simply uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list and add each element to the sum.\n\n2. Sieve of Eratosthenes:\n\nThe sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given positive integer `n`. If `n` is a prime number, then `n` must be the only exception, and then iterate through all integers until there are no more primes to check.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(n):",

You can identify three consecutive factors and their corresponding multiples:\n\n* 52\n* 29\n* 94 (product of all three consecutive factors)\n* 22\n* Nullity: \"index\"\n\n$$52 * 29 + 94 + Nullity = (29 * 29) + 1410 + Nullity = (52 * 29) + 1410 = 1195 + 1410$$\n\n**Step 2: Simplifying**\n\nNow, we need to simplify the expression.
