It starts with a smaller value than `-90` in the first case, since `-90` is a finite number. Then, it calculates the difference between the smaller value and the larger number. The sign of the difference depends on whether the difference is positive or negative. When the difference is positive, the sign is positive and when the difference is negative, the sign is negative.

          "by Aidan Dowling\nDate: August 2020\n\nThe release of this AI assistant has made many people excited about the possibilities it holds for our daily lives. From streamlining tasks and delegating work to providing valuable insights and mapping out potential routes, this technology has the potential to make a significant impact. But as amazing as this technology is, there are many other ways in which it can be used to benefit humanity.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of AI assistants like myself is that they can provide 24/7 monitoring and support. This means that if someone unexpectedly logs in to your account, you can quickly take action to resolve any issues rather than having to wait until a human representative comes to file a complaint. This is particularly important for those who work remotely or have limited resources, as it can help prevent productivity downtime and reduce the need for costly EE or remote support.\n\nAnother way in which AI assistants can make a positive impact is by leveraging data and analytics to improve communication and collaboration. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, AI assistants can provide personalized recommendations for communication channels, content, and engagement tactics. This can help make it easier for organizations to tailor their communications to specific audiences and stay on top of the conversation.\n"

          "Let's start by simplifying each term individually:\n\nFirst term: Have you seen the common denominator of 247 and 10,432? The fraction would be equivalent to 247/(10,432), which is 1/138, which has a common denominator of 12 = 18. So, we have:\n\n247/1197 = 1/138 = 0.09266\n\nNext term: What about the common denominator of 1197 and 39,489? The fraction would be equivalent to 1197/(39,489), which is 11/1022, which has a common denominator of 335,884 = 31.8. So, we have:\n\n11/1022 = 0.009244\n\nNext term: The common denominator of 1022+39,489 is the same as 138. So, our next term becomes:\n\n0.009244 = 0.92",
