We can determine the GCD by considering multiples of 3 and 5 that are not powers of 3 (i.e. a quotient of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10). For example, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 are common multiples of 3 and 5. We can thus determine the GCD as follows: 2 and 3. Since 6 is a power of 2, we can conclude that the GCD of 2 and 3 is 1. Now, we write down 1 as the GCD: 1. Through this approach, we can express 464/29 as its simplified fraction, equivalent to $\\frac{16}{12}$.\nThat's all for today!",

After that, you can combine the simplified fraction and the modified denominator of $464X$ to find the final answer.\n\nFirst, write the fraction in its simplest form, which is $29/464$. The numerator $29$ is a multiple of 3, so it is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe denominator $464$ is an odd number and is expressed as $3 \\cdot 464$. Since the numerator is even, it must be cancelled out. Take $464$ out from the numerator and find the same thing in the denominator.\n\nAfter canceling out the numerator $464$, we know that the denominator is $464X$. Write the reduced fraction in simplest form, which is $464/X$.\n\nTo find the final answer, combine the simplified fraction and the modified denominator $464X$, which is $464/464X$.

The while loop is the basic building block of a BF program. While is the conditional statement that begins iterations, minus significant moves is a boolean value that keeps track of the current moves (positive or negative) and the resulting critical branch (if significant moves are present).\n2. The `get operating_state` in the program takes input from the user as text. It checks if it's on input and resumes steps 2 & 3.\n3. `shift -ificant moves preferred` uses the `first` operation of `get oper_state` to swap `order` and subtract `significant` moves from the input.\n4.
